			<title>Pilot data for dissertation Experiment 4</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/10/28/pilotDataForDissertationExperiment4.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I proposed an additional dissertation experiment and am amid data collection for it. My research assistant Deniz and I have consented 40 subjects. Two subject numbers were unable to complete the study in the allotted time (#13 and #14). We re-ran a new #14, but still need to re-run a #13. Somehow we also skipped #10. Thus, when data collection resumes tomorrow, we'll do 10, 13, and 41. The reason subject numbers are important in my study is that they're tied in the programming to the counterbalancing groups and experimental conditions. Thus, if one number is no good, we just throw it out and get another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reason to go in and look at the data mid-data collection is just to ensure that everyone's completing the study as expected and that there are no bugs or glitches in the program. This process alerted me to one potential issue -- currently, if someone doesn't make a source decision (i.e., they selected NEW on the source test), I grade their source accuracy as INCORRECT. Obviously this is wrong -- when computing overall source accuracy, we should only look at OLD responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the potential to get pretty sticky and confusing as things progress, so I'll have to think carefully about these issues while working on the writeup.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;It's a good day today -- we found out that our paper was accepted for publication in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;. I've been vague when discussing it for a while now (heck, maybe for even a year or so) as to not spoil the punchline, and it turns out that the contents are under embargo for at least another month or two anyway, so I can't share many details. What I can share, though, is that it should be a neat paper of general interest. Hopefully, too, it'll start to raise some interesting questions for collective memory researchers, as well as suggest some new ways of considering an interesting set of questions in a quantitative way. Keep an eye on this space and I'll start sharing things as soon as I have the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Back to blogging, part two</title>

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;It's been about three months without any updates here -- my apologies about that. The reason is that I stopped using Dropbox, and without Dropbox, there's no way to update this blog. There have been a few times when I've wanted to write a post, though, and for that reason I decided to reactivate Dropbox just for blogging purposes. So, hopefully, there'll be more of this to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I stop using Dropbox, you might ask? Through a pretty roundabout set of developments. I've fallen in love with Google+ Photos. I love how the pictures I take on my iPhone are uploaded to the cloud, auto-enhanced, and organized in a meaningful way. I ran out of space on my Google Drive because I uploaded some photos. Because it didn't make sense to maintain some files in Dropbox and some in Google Drive, I eliminated Dropbox -- after all, their photo tools are inferior, even considering Carousel (which I haven't looked into in a while; I ought to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bottom line -- Google+ Photos are awesome. They're so good, in fact, I think I'm going to get a Nexus 6 when they're announced instead of an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Getting back into research blogging</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/07/30/gettingBackIntoResearchBlogging.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks I've been spending a lot of time on a top-secret project and professional development-type things, so there hasn't been too much to discuss in research notes. The good news, though, is that (I believe) data collection is completed for the third experiment of my dissertation. We have 64 subjects, evenly balanced in terms of counterbalancing condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've not done much in the way of analysis on these data but one thing I'm looking at is whether the general pattern of results replicate what I've discussed in earlier places. So far it looks as if this is the case, which is good to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A few seconds ago I refreshed my Twitter page to see that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://college.usatoday.com/2014/07/29/aiming-for-an-a-study-habits-you-should-adopt-and-avoid/&quot;&gt;USA Today post is out about a recent study techniques review&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely, no link to the original article is included. I can't find one either in a few minutes of searching.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I've been working on in free time is the Data Science specialization track offered through Coursera and Johns Hopkins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripBottom&quot;&gt;You might find it interesting, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to have interesting things here myself over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Data collection is going well. There's no longer a need for 50-59 year olds, as you can see from the figure below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/9fv1pq6bt8irh89/Screenshot%202014-05-23%2008.59.39.png&quot; alt=&quot;Subject counts&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the slow wait for those 60 and up begins. We are getting about seven a day, assuming the rate between the 21st and today remains constant, so I expect this step should take a little over a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I also ought to be considering those indicating they cheated on the test. We have 23 self-identified cheaters out of 480 subjects, which is roughly a rate of one in 20 -- not great. I'll have to decide whether to re-run an equivalent number of subjects or just leave it be (likely, I'll just leave it be).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;We need 31 50-59 year olds and 72 60-69 year olds. I opened new MTurk slots for folks 50+ and hope to get those rolling in soon. Chances are good the 70-89 age range will go relatively unfilled; currently, that group has been less than half of one percent of our participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more a note for myself than for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Recognition memory vs. source memory calibration curves</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/05/08/recognitionMemoryVsSourceMemoryCalibrationCurves.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I posted some calibration curves for &lt;i&gt;remembering&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;knowing&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;guessing&lt;/i&gt;. (It turns out they were constructed from pilot data instead of the full data set accidentally, but the same pattern bears out). In the third experiment of my dissertation -- I have 32 of 64 subjects' worth of data collected so far -- we get both recognition (old/new) accuracy and source accuracy and thus are able to plot two calibration plots, one for recognition and one for source. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/9iugg0gsoudt4fu/Screenshot%202014-05-08%2010.47.36.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calibration curves&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look pretty similar, which is both good and bad news. First note that, at least by eyeball, there's a bigger difference at high confidence (that's the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-axis, which I'm noticing I've left out) for source memory than old/new accuracy for &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;. Some prior literature, however, predicts that that &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; curve for source accuracy should not really be exceeding any point falling on the remember curve. Clearly, though, 80-100 confidence &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; are more accurate, in terms of source, than 0-79 confidence &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is going to be something I have to think about over the next few days. I think it might come down to the instructions. In my study, subjects make a recognition + source decision, then confidence, than &lt;i&gt;remember/know/guess&lt;/i&gt;. This order -- as well as the specific prompt for the confidence rating -- might end up being very important in this line of research. Hmm...&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Calibration curves for remembering, knowing, and guessing</title>

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Quiet April here on the blog -- I spent most of the month running subjects and working on another project I can't talk too much about yet. In the meantime, though, I'm preparing for the Show Me Mini Mental Life Conference, a small biannual (that means once every two years, right, or is that &quot;biennial&quot;) conference jointly hosted by Washington University and Mizzou a bit down I-64. I'm giving a talk on some of my dissertation data, which I've written about in other places (&lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html&quot;&gt;Project 15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might know, my dissertation research is interested in confidence-accuracy differences as a function of &lt;i&gt;remembering&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;knowing&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;guessing&lt;/i&gt;. What we can do is plot calibration curves for the accuracy of responses given while in each qualitative state of remembering. Here's the figure: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/cud4eywjczlgxog/Screenshot%202014-05-05%2014.25.58.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calibration curves&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the figure shows, one type of response seems to pull apart from the rest. Namely, we see that &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; responses given with high (e.g., 80-100) confidence appear to be significantly more accurate, on average, than &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; responses given with lower confidence as well as any &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; responses. Thus, the real-world implication is that if I'm sure I remember something, and can remember specific details about that memory (rather than a gut feeling or hunch that it happened), it's likely that the memory is an accurate one.&lt;/p&gt;

What we can do is plot calibration curves for the accuracy of responses given while in each qualitative state of remembering. Here's the figure: " created="Mon, 05 May 2014 19:41:49 GMT" />

				<source:outline text="As the figure shows, one type of response seems to pull apart from the rest. Namely, we see that &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; responses given with high (e.g., 80-100) confidence appear to be significantly more accurate, on average, than &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; responses given with lower confidence as well as any &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; responses. Thus, the real-world implication is that if I'm sure I remember something, and can remember specific details about that memory (rather than a gut feeling or hunch that it happened), it's likely that the memory is an accurate one." created="Mon, 05 May 2014 19:42:49 GMT" />

			<title>Pilot data for dissertation experiment</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/04/22/pilotDataForDissertationExperiment.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Thanks to data collection efforts last week I have seven subjects' worth of pilot data for &lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html&quot;&gt;Project 15&lt;/a&gt; Experiment 3. The temporary Excel file is saved as &quot;E2 Pilot Data Check.xlsx&quot; in the Dropbox folder. The first step was to ensure that no data has been lost as a result of programming errors. The good news is that all subjects have 100 observations in the study phase and 300 in the recognition test phase, which means nothing's getting swallowed up. This is great.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is taking a look at recognition memory performance and comparing it with prior research. Right now &quot;old&quot; rates for targets, related lures, and unrelated lures are .81, .47 and .17 respectively. Data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html&quot;&gt;Project 15&lt;/a&gt; Experiment 2 are in the same ballpark (.71, .29, .17). So initial data collection suggests folks are more conservative in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 2, which is certainly a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now some time needs to be spent thinking about which analyses are the crucial ones in Experiment 3. Let's recopy what I wrote as a summary of the Experiment 2 data: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, targets receive remember responses and related lures receive know and guess responses. Confidence ratings are highest for remember, intermediate for know, and lowest for guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are not significant differences in calibration (between-subjects and between-events) between remember and know responses. There are, however, significant differences in resolution (within-subjects and within-items). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Experiment 2 of my dissertation proves that qualitative state of remembering (remembering versus knowing) affects the strength of the confidence-accuracy correlation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question is calibration and resolution for the source accuracy-confidence relationship, I think. Everything else is icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far -- and this is a super quick analysis -- there's an interesting difference in confidence-accuracy relationship depending on whether we're looking at recognition or source accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/icf8rux0yuxcv86/Screenshot%202014-04-22%2014.46.25.png&quot; alt=&quot;Confidence-Accuracy Correlations&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Photo organization: I give up. Please help me.</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/04/18/photoOrganizationIGiveUpPleaseHelpMe.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I have been taking digital photographs since 2003. My collection is a mess, and I have no idea what to do about it. Everything from 2003-2009 is on an external hard drive, basically, and 2009 on is on the hard drive of the machine I'm updating currently. In 2003 it made sense to organize photos by albums, but in the modern era of cellphone cameras and one or two pictures per day forever, it makes more sense to organize in other ways (e.g., day/month/year, faces, locations). Much of my stuff is in Aperture right now, which I purchased thinking it would be a helpful upgrade over iPhoto, but it was a waste of money -- I feel it works even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I do? Here's what I'm thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Get all the files in one location, on my computer. File structure doesn't matter as much as having everything in one place does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Back those up on multiple drives in multiple locations, including the cloud (not sure where to go here -- Flickr offers the free terabyte, but I'd rather pay for Dropbox or Google. Meanwhile, most of my devices play the nicest with iCloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Find some photo organizer/viewer that works the best. Whether this is iPhoto, Aperture, Picasa, or what I don't know and can't say. I guess this will take some research. (It seems as if photo organization has really taken a hit in the current era of the closed web, doesn't it?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Start to organize in a way that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Back all of that up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I right? Am I wrong? Any hints? Please help!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;My acquaintance &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/walt-hickey/&quot;&gt;Walter Hickey&lt;/a&gt;, from FiveThirtyEight, made an interesting comment that I wanted to address in over 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/becky_koenig&quot;&gt;@becky_koenig&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kadesoto&quot;&gt;@kadesoto&lt;/a&gt; also, readers, commenters and other publications are almost certainly more grilling than a peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Walter Hickey (@WaltHickey) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WaltHickey/statuses/453984414687821826&quot;&gt;April 9, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting idea to think about. At face value the idea makes sense -- a million people out there, any number of which have the time, energy, and expertise to evaluate your writing critically. But I'm not sure the evidence is out there suggesting that people actually do that. When I read critiques of news articles, they seem partisan or opinion based -- &quot;I think this article is wrong because I disagree with you.&quot; Peer review, at its best, does more than this. Readers and commenters will be quick to pick up on and take down obvious flaws and logical fallacies. But can you count on them to investigate statistical analyses, interpretations of scientific theory? Do your readers know how to bootstrap, score psychological measures, or do a shift of benchwork?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of them do, but it's irresponsible to assume that those people are out there and are willing and motivated to clean up any mistakes you made. Scientific peer review, despite its faults, ensures that at least some wise brains have the professional responsibility to evaluate your arguments. Ideally, it matches up subject matter experts -- people who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; bootstrap and evaluate theory, to continue the example -- to papers that require it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data journalists would be wise to seek out impartial reviewers instead of assuming that readers, commenters, and other publications will do the job of ensuring accuracy for them.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Thinking about observation counts again</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/04/08/thinkingAboutObservationCountsAgain.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;So more for my notes than anything else, here's a figure that shows the number of times subjects say &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; with varying levels of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/02wxlmogk9z5djz/Screenshot%202014-04-08%2014.22.37.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that there's an overwhelming number of maximum confidence &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; responses. These responses are made with confidence ratings of 90 to 100. Some take this as evidence that the phenomenon of &lt;i&gt;remembering&lt;/i&gt; is all-or-none -- perhaps the observations of &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; assigned lower confidence values are just noise.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Solving a little puzzle</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/04/04/solvingALittlePuzzle.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;My dissertation research is turning out to be somewhat timely -- a colleague of mine in the Behavior, Brain, and Cognition program recently gave a brief talk for the department reporting that she wasn't able to find some of the results reported in another paper (one relevant to my dissertation). I suppose it's not quite my place to talk about it here, so I'll just attach the figure, for my own reference, that adds to the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/b1bo9lhq8jxng0y/Screenshot%202014-04-03%2012.59.40.png&quot; alt=&quot;Replication of Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, you can e-mail me directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interesting issue raises a larger point that I have been concerned about for a few weeks now. To what extent is a fellow researcher authorized to discuss research presented in department talks and colloquia? What is the best way to cover topics discussed in these sessions? Traditionally, researchers discuss data that are in progress or have not been finalized, published, or sometimes even double-checked. At the same time, though, it's rare to hear a presenter warn, &quot;Please don't tell others about this research until it has been published.&quot; So what is the appropriate way to share an interesting talk you've heard? Do you only discuss work that has been published, as a ground rule? Do you speak about unpublished research, but in a vague way? Do you assume that if the research has been presented in a public talk, it's fair game? Is there a difference when research is presented in a lab meeting versus a brown bag versus a department talk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps someone older and wiser than me can share their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Notes on Migo, Mayes, and Montaldi (2012)</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/31/notesOnMigoMayesAndMontaldi2012.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Getting around to reading this neat review of the &lt;i&gt;remember/know&lt;/i&gt; procedure written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001298&quot;&gt;Migo, Mayes, and Montaldi (2012)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls&quot;&gt;&lt;i class = &quot;fa fa-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It covers some interesting issues in the use of &lt;i&gt;remember/know&lt;/i&gt; judgments as well as some best practices. Here are some assorted notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1437: A messy figure good for showing the complicated confidence/&lt;i&gt;RKG&lt;/i&gt;/memory interrelationships&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1439: Distinctions between &lt;i&gt;remember/know&lt;/i&gt; and source memory tasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1441: The beginning of a helpful section relating &lt;i&gt;remember/know&lt;/i&gt; to confidence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1442: Citation to Smith, Wixted, and Squire (2011), which I should add to the reading list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1443: Discussion of how &quot;false recollection&quot; can be due to &quot;true,&quot; yet mis-connected, recollections&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also outline some valuable guidelines for working with &lt;i&gt;RKG&lt;/i&gt; judgments in the laboratory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include the exact instructions in the manuscript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe any instruction checks used during the experiment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe any instruction checks used after the experiment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declare any rules for elimination or replacing of subjects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include &quot;the measurement assumption used to calculate familiarity performance&quot; (p. 1446)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these are self-evident, but it's good to see them in print. Later on (p. 1446) there's a discussion of how the Rajaram (1993) instructions suggest that &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; responses can only be made when a subject is certain an item was presented. This isn't true, and Montaldi et al. (2006) discusses this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1448: An interesting suggestion that subjects who have &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; rates over 50% should be excluded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1449: A recommendation against using &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; responses -- oops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p. 1449: Some criticisms of Ingram et al. (2012), which my work is partially inspired by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, a valuable article that'll be added to the project folder.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>More personal data tracking: Net calories</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/31/morePersonalDataTrackingNetCalories.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I went out with some friends on Friday night and was surprised to get at least four comments, from people I don't talk to on a regular basis, about my updates (which most come across via Facebook). The gist of the comments is that my updates seemed frequent, but not yet to the point of irritation -- at least I hope! -- and occasionally even a little interesting. Hannah gave some good feedback and said she wanted to see a little more personal data, so I'll oblige -- direct any complaints to her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her first note that it would be good to see some mood and psychological wellbeing data. I haven't collected any of that yet, so I decided to start. I signed up for the Track Your Happiness project -- which I've done before -- and &lt;a href=&quot;http://trackyourhappiness.org&quot;&gt;which you can do here&lt;/a&gt;. More on that when I get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime I thought I would present some data on nutrition and calories (another suggested topic), in case it's a area of interest. Here is a &lt;i&gt;rough&lt;/i&gt; approximation of my net calories consumed since January 1. This figure represents the amount I've eaten in a day minus any exercise I've done (the red line is my rough total expenditure for a given day without any exercise):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/npruzf2tcmn3btq/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.42.19.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of us I started the new year off with a diet but also a marathon training plan (I'm a firm believer in the strategy of &quot;over-promise and under-deliver&quot;). The general upward trend in net calories suggests that the diet has tapered off as the amount of running has increased. Around February 23 or so, I upped things even more (and as a result have been less conscientious about tracking such things).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compare this figure with total calories (or maybe we should call this &quot;gross calories&quot;?):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nycrwekebk5rs6z/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.55.02.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make any comparisons you like, I suppose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note: Of course this tracking is imprecise and most likely underestimates intake significantly (and never overestimates). So things may look a little stricter than they actually were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping this is interesting somehow!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Introductory podcast on dissertation work</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/27/introductoryPodcastOnDissertationWork.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I've been writing about my dissertation research here for a while now, but of course it makes very little sense getting these updates &lt;i&gt;in media res&lt;/i&gt;. I've held off on writing an introductory post because doing so would take too many words and would not be all too fun to read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided: Why not do a brief audio post on it, instead, so you can get caught up if you like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/z07e6fn6ys41ju1/15%20Intro.mp3&quot;&gt;Take a listen&lt;/a&gt;. It's a 12 minute recording. I hope to get better at these things as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get a chance to listen in, I would love to get some comments and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also added a link to the podcast on the project overview page -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html&quot;&gt;Project 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Learning the basics of stats in Python</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/26/learningTheBasicsOfStatsInPython.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I have a few free minutes today, so I've been spending some time learning how to use Python for statistical programming. It is not a friendly learning curve so far. &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/&quot;&gt;I started by installing Anaconda&lt;/a&gt;, a package that includes, as far as I can tell, everything you need to get started. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipython.org/&quot;&gt;Once I did that I got IPython running&lt;/a&gt;, which is -- again, as far as I can tell -- a browser-based client for doing stats in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I mostly followed a tutorial that assumed I knew &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; more than I actually did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A neat feature I discovered is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipython.org/&quot;&gt;you can use the IPython Notebook Viewer to share your statistics with others&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/Basics.ipynb.json?create=1&quot;&gt;Click on this link here to see the stats that I ran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that I conducted a t-test, and a one-way ANOVA! On what, that's a good question, but at least I executed those steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clearly, here's what I need to learn in order to get useful at this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to take data off of my webservers and get them into IPython&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run basic t-tests and ANOVAs with said data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do correlation and regression analyses with said data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these things sound &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; difficult -- rather, it's the conditional analyzing, etc. (e.g., averaging across subjects -- how does one do this?) -- that'll be challenging to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any tips, tricks, or good places to get started, feel free to share them.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Examining item characteristics</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/24/examiningItemCharacteristics.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;So, in my dissertation work, subjects study some items and take a test on studied and unstudied items. When subjects indicate an item was &quot;old,&quot; or previously studied, they judge whether they &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;guess &lt;/i&gt;that the item is old. &lt;i&gt;Remember&lt;/i&gt; responses are provided when subjects can mentally recollect the moment of the item's occurrence in the list. &lt;i&gt;Know&lt;/i&gt; responses are made when subjects think they saw the item on the list but can't recollect presentation details. Last, subjects are told to make a &lt;i&gt;guess &lt;/i&gt;response when they're just guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also happens that the items are categorized words that vary in terms of &lt;i&gt;response frequency&lt;/i&gt;, which is a sort of typicality. Common category members (like &lt;i&gt;eagle&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;birds&lt;/i&gt; category) have a low response frequency (e.g., 1 or 2), whereas less common category members have a high response frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wondered if subjects might be much more likely to respond &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; to a high response frequency item than a low response frequency item, and likewise for &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt;. To investigate I took the average response frequency for each subjects' &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; responses. I divided these into correct responses (i.e., hits) and incorrect responses (i.e., false alarms), and here's what we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mqphmtjzwi9zkx6/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2016.09.16.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much of a difference. I haven't run any significance tests on these data but there's nothing shocking -- in other words, subjects seem equally likely to respond &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt;, whether correctly or incorrectly, to items of all output dominance values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you agree with my interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Exploring issues of empty cells</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/24/exploringIssuesOfEmptyCells.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;In our confidence-accuracy relationship research, one analysis we're interested in is called the &lt;i&gt;between-events&lt;/i&gt; confidence-accuracy correlation. This between-events analysis describes the extent to which events or items (e.g., words) that are responded to with greater confidence are also more likely to be responded to correctly. My dissertation research aims to obtain between-events correlations (as well as correlations of other types) for items responded to with &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; after an &quot;old&quot; recognition decision (read up on the &lt;i&gt;remember/know&lt;/i&gt; procedure for some background here).&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this particular confidence-accuracy correlation, we take each item and get an average confidence and average accuracy for each, then plot the trendline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, though, is that there are some items which only receive a recognition decision of &quot;old&quot; a small number of times in the study. The objective in this analysis was to exclude those items for which only a few &quot;old&quot; responses were given and see if the resulting confidence-accuracy correlations differ dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, I filtered out items for which there were fewer than 2, 6, or 11 observations and recomputed the confidence-accuracy correlations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7p0stqqr6nj2k7n/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2014.46.02.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are no big changes. Most items get at least 10 &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; responses and most also get 5 &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; responses. Most items also get 1 &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; response. Regardless of the number of items which are taken out, too, the confidence-accuracy relationships are remaining steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the SPSS matrix when we leave everything in, for future reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dhlzla80gfqyhph/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2014.25.19.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Just ignore the crosstabs for the comparisons that aren't relevant. Focus on the diagonals.)&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Light readings in the apartment</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/24/lightReadingsInTheApartment.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Another little side project: I rigged together an Arduino, an Ethernet Shield, and a photometer in the apartment. You can take a look at the code -- mostly spliced together through different tutorials -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kadesoto/Arduino-Ethernet-Project&quot;&gt;on my Github&lt;/a&gt;. It takes a reading of the light in the apartment every 15 seconds and uploads it to Xively, which handles the visualization. Here's what it looks like over the last three days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/uwohs4u1g8b5b6z/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2012.01.48.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see a neat, regular pattern. I'm not exactly sure what the general patterns indicate -- this is all hypothesis at this point -- but we see a peak in the morning when I get ready for work or the day with the lights on and maximum brightness. In fact, I think you can even tell the unit's in a room with eastward facing windows -- a big blast of sun as it rises, followed by a general decrease in light over the day. I think some of the noise is due to different lights that are being turned on and off in the room, but also cloudiness. The third day worth of data is much smoother. I wonder if this means the day was sunnier (i.e., less cloudy) and I messed around less with the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else I ought to test? Eventually, I should move the unit into my office, which has windows that face to the south. I bet you'd find the light pattern to be much more normally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this? Agree or disagree with my informal analysis?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Experience sampling data </title>

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;A break from your regularly scheduled program -- here's a new entry in Personal Data Friday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month I've been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://reporter-app.com&quot;&gt;Reporter&lt;/a&gt;, an experience sampling iPhone app designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feltron.com&quot;&gt;personal analytics czar Nicholas Felton&lt;/a&gt; that probes me at random times during my waking hours to determine what I'm up to and who I'm with. Experience sampling is a technique that's been used for a long time in the autobiographical memory literature (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/1987/09000/Validity_and_Reliability_of_the.4.aspx&quot;&gt;Csikszentmihalyi &amp;amp; Larson, 1987&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls&quot;&gt;&lt;i class = &quot;fa fa-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)), so I was excited to find an opportunity to apply the technique to my own life. The idea is that over time, the data recorded at random intervals during the day begins to approximate a clear snapshot of one's entire life. Of course, with a limited handful of data points, this method of estimation may not be particularly accurate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's take a look at a random sample of daily activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zeo73cy5f2gidq8/What%20Doing.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see I've spent a lot of time working on the computer, but a similar amount of time socializing (hanging out with friends, being with people, etc.). A disappointing amount of my time is spent waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the question &quot;Where are you?&quot; I most often report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/bnsajvj2xobl1q0/Where%20At.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically at home or at work. Home beats out the Psychology Building by a fair margin here because I have been working from home a bit more than usual lately. You can see that I haven't spent a significant amount of time anywhere else -- everything else is basically individual observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, who I'm with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/1k6d5rjzfannnw9/Who%20With.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of alone time, lots of significant other time, then it's down to buddies. Becky and I spend a lot of time together, clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't think I can keep this project up much longer -- it's a little too disruptive to do and I don't like the switch you have to flip to go to bed at the end of the day (I keep forgetting to toggle it, so get polled during sleeping hours by accident). It was a neat project while it lasted, though!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Another neat finding</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/20/anotherNeatFinding.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;In a meeting with Roddy yesterday he suggested I conduct a conceptual replication of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/38/2/325/&quot;&gt;Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls&quot;&gt;&lt;i class = &quot;fa fa-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) study in which the authors showed that &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; judgments made with high confidence are, on average, more likely to be correct than &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; judgments made with lower confidence. This is an interesting finding because it means that &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; judgments aren't functionally equivalent to memories held with high confidence. This is stated well in the title of this paper: &quot;Recollection (i.e., as indexed by &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; judgments) can be weak and familiarity (as indexed by &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt;) can be strong.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I divided up all &quot;old&quot; recognition decisions by whether they were &lt;i&gt;remembered&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;known&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;guessed&lt;/i&gt; and looked at their average accuracy across confidence bins of 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, and 75-100. And here's what we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, my findings support the discoveries of Ingram and colleagues. &lt;i&gt;Know&lt;/i&gt; judgments made with high (i.e., 76-100) confidence are more likely to be correct than &lt;i&gt;remember&lt;/i&gt; judgments made with lower (i.e., 26-50) confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Redoing a figure</title>
			<link>http://technimentis.com/2014/03/20/redoingAFigure.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while we researchers have the pleasure of recreating a historic or classic figure for reuse in a presentation or paper. It's a zenlike experience to engage in this process of re-transcription. Today's mission was to redo Figure 1 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/64/5/482/&quot;&gt;a 1962 paper by Bennet Murdock&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls&quot;&gt;&lt;i class = &quot;fa fa-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on the serial position curve in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the original figure...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and here's my redo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/g7093qxzwvpmgi0/Screenshot%202014-03-20%2011.02.11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the new figure is much more flexible (can be edited, etc.) and vector rather than raster (can be resized, reshaped, etc., without loss of quality), there's a real elegance to the original figure. In particular, I bumped into issues recreating the &quot;shiny&quot; bubbles of the 20-1 condition in the original, so I had to settle for a less interesting (but perhaps more readable) intermediate gray shade. Additionally, it's not so easy to create those &quot;legend arrows&quot; from the original, so I stuck with a more traditional legend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did the original figure creator get right? What did he or she get wrong? I was about to assume the figure was Murdock's work, but it occurred to me that the journal typesetter or editor may have created the figure. I think I have seen similar figures in papers by other authors, but am not certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I utilize a feature of Fargo, my outlining system, for the first time in this post. Above, I link to Murdock's paper but, like so many other academic works, it's behind a paywall. In order to indicate this, I enter a little tag I invented myself -- [ paywall ] -- and Fargo renders a dollar sign icon. Later today I'll link the icon to some information about paywalls.   &lt;/p&gt;

				<source:outline text="Every once in a while we researchers have the pleasure of recreating a historic or classic figure for reuse in a presentation or paper. It's a zenlike experience to engage in this process of re-transcription.
