		<p>Been a hectic week with a paper release imminent and Psychonomics on its way. Not to mention the Thanksgiving holiday is up in a little over a week, too. Well, the good news is with the November holidays over I'll be able to focus full-time on my dissertation again, and get that ball rolling for what should be the final time. Once we hit December it should be a good kind of freefall from there. </p>

<p>Another project I've been thinking about is something that's in the works with <a href="http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/stevesmith/">Dr. Steve Smith</a>, who's visiting from Texas A&amp;M this year. We're interested in some forensic questions that are a bit more applied than the other things I've tacked in graduate school. Hopefully there will be some interesting things to report in this space a little later.  </p>

<p>But, as the title of the post says, with everything that's going on, it's a bad time to have doubled (tripled?) my daily coffee intake. I wonder if it's affecting my sleep, too, although a recent night of sleep (slept in a bit, don't judge) looks pretty unconcerning:</p>

		<p>Submitted what's probably the last version of our page proofs for our paper today. This means that it's likely the article will be published sometime before the end of the year, and quite possibly before the end of November -- who knows, it's hard to say. Continue to stay tuned; there's probably nothing more to say on the manuscript until it's published.</p>

<p>Which reminds me that I need to work on an IRB modification to get the task up and online. This needs to happen pretty quickly, so I should stop writing updates and get on that immediately.</p>

		<p>A few accomplishments today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Looked over Adam's paper draft that he'll be resubmitting in a few hours. It's looking pretty good. Will try and link to it once it's published.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of the day was spent working on proofreading and editing the <i>Science </i>paper, and other rigamarole associated with getting the publication out the door. The page proofs are looking really nice and it'll be exciting to share it with readers here before the end of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>Also spent some time working on a few professional development issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Deniz is running seven (or so) subjects as we speak.</p></li>
<li><p>And lastly, the day was capped off by a pleasant surprise visit by <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~ab259/">Andrew Butler</a>, Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He's a fabulous researcher who is bound to continue a great career in the land of beef brisket.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. Made arrangements for another meeting with <a href="http://neonelectrons.webs.com/">the Neon Electrons</a> this Friday.</p>

<p>I bumped into an error with my new experiment file so had to re-download it to a memory stick. I'm headed into the testing room now to get the updated copy on all of the machines.</p>

		<p>15-E4 was only set up to take 80 different subject numbers, except this experiment's going to require 80 folks at least -- probably more like 96 - 128. So I went in to the source code and increased the range of allowable subject numbers. </p>

<p>I took that as an opportunity to create a new Github repository for the source code of the experiment. <a href="https://github.com/kadesoto/15-E4">You can get to it by clicking here</a>. Since I do most of my coding on the timeline, things don't work as well as they ought to, but you can still download and explore the software yourself if you're interested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/4/7154107/amazon-prime-customers-now-get-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-photos">just noticed this headline</a> about Amazon offering unlimited photo storage to Prime customers. A few thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Before long, it won't be the space that's the seller, rather, who can offer the best search, organization, filtering, etc. In my opinion Google's top here for the time being, partly because of the auto-enhance features.</p></li>
<li><p>The more places can host your photos for free, the more likely they are to be backed up in more than one location. But that also means that's one more place your photo is floating around for someone to access it against your will. Say you take a photo you didn't mean to and it's automatically beamed to an unlimited number of backup systems. How do you ever make sure you've deleted it! Security's also going to be more important in this area.</p></li>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/11/03/readRowland2014.html">Read Rowland (2014)</a></div>
		<p>For lab meeting this week we're reading a testing effect review by Rowland (2014). It is a heroic effort. The main ideas are summed up well on p. 21, in the Conclusions section, where it is noted that a retrieval difficulty hypothesis is supported, whereas a transfer-appropriate processing account is not. Additional support was found for semantic elaboration accounts, like Mary's mediator hypothesis, but the bottom line is that currently, no one unifying account can explain all testing data.</p>

<p>Another interesting finding was that benefits of testing emerged immediately as well as a delay, which dovetails with some things Karpicke has been saying lately about the "crossover" in testing being an artifact of test difficulty and item selection effects.</p>

<p>The somewhat unsatisfying, but honest, conclusion is on p. 22, where it is stated that "the underlying mechanisms that produce the effect remain elusive," and that "the testing effect is likely to reflect multiple memory mechanisms." In other words, there's lots more work to be done.</p>

		<p>The IRB for my main research line was expiring soon, so this morning I submitted a continuing review form to keep it open, noting that 63 additional subjects had been consented since the last time I did the review. I also added Lena to the IRB so that she can help with data collection in the case that I am incapacitated (or, more likely, am unable to make into the lab for whatever reason).</p>

<p>Edit: The IRB has been approved.</p>
