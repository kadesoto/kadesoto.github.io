		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/26/learningTheBasicsOfStatsInPython.html">Learning the basics of stats in Python</a></div>
		<p>I have a few free minutes today, so I've been spending some time learning how to use Python for statistical programming. It is not a friendly learning curve so far. <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">I started by installing Anaconda</a>, a package that includes, as far as I can tell, everything you need to get started. <a href="http://ipython.org/">Once I did that I got IPython running</a>, which is -- again, as far as I can tell -- a browser-based client for doing stats in Python.</p>

<p>Then I mostly followed a tutorial that assumed I knew <i>way</i> more than I actually did.</p>

<p>A neat feature I discovered is that <a href="http://ipython.org/">you can use the IPython Notebook Viewer to share your statistics with others</a>. <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/Basics.ipynb.json?create=1">Click on this link here to see the stats that I ran</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that I conducted a t-test, and a one-way ANOVA! On what, that's a good question, but at least I executed those steps.</p>

<p>So clearly, here's what I need to learn in order to get useful at this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to take data off of my webservers and get them into IPython</p></li>
<li><p>Run basic t-tests and ANOVAs with said data</p></li>
<li><p>Do correlation and regression analyses with said data</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things sound <i>too</i> difficult -- rather, it's the conditional analyzing, etc. (e.g., averaging across subjects -- how does one do this?) -- that'll be challenging to learn.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips, tricks, or good places to get started, feel free to share them.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/24/examiningItemCharacteristics.html">Examining item characteristics</a></div>
		<p>So, in my dissertation work, subjects study some items and take a test on studied and unstudied items. When subjects indicate an item was "old," or previously studied, they judge whether they <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, or <i>guess </i>that the item is old. <i>Remember</i> responses are provided when subjects can mentally recollect the moment of the item's occurrence in the list. <i>Know</i> responses are made when subjects think they saw the item on the list but can't recollect presentation details. Last, subjects are told to make a <i>guess </i>response when they're just guessing.</p>

<p>It also happens that the items are categorized words that vary in terms of <i>response frequency</i>, which is a sort of typicality. Common category members (like <i>eagle</i> from the <i>birds</i> category) have a low response frequency (e.g., 1 or 2), whereas less common category members have a high response frequency.</p>

<p>We wondered if subjects might be much more likely to respond <i>remember</i> to a high response frequency item than a low response frequency item, and likewise for <i>know</i> and <i>guess</i>. To investigate I took the average response frequency for each subjects' <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> responses. I divided these into correct responses (i.e., hits) and incorrect responses (i.e., false alarms), and here's what we get:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mqphmtjzwi9zkx6/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2016.09.16.png"></p>

<p>Not much of a difference. I haven't run any significance tests on these data but there's nothing shocking -- in other words, subjects seem equally likely to respond <i>remember</i>, whether correctly or incorrectly, to items of all output dominance values.</p>

<p>Do you agree with my interpretation?</p>

		<p>In our confidence-accuracy relationship research, one analysis we're interested in is called the <i>between-events</i> confidence-accuracy correlation. This between-events analysis describes the extent to which events or items (e.g., words) that are responded to with greater confidence are also more likely to be responded to correctly. My dissertation research aims to obtain between-events correlations (as well as correlations of other types) for items responded to with <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, or <i>guess</i> after an "old" recognition decision (read up on the <i>remember/know</i> procedure for some background here).<i> </i></p>

<p>To get this particular confidence-accuracy correlation, we take each item and get an average confidence and average accuracy for each, then plot the trendline.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that there are some items which only receive a recognition decision of "old" a small number of times in the study. The objective in this analysis was to exclude those items for which only a few "old" responses were given and see if the resulting confidence-accuracy correlations differ dramatically.</p>

<p>To do this, I filtered out items for which there were fewer than 2, 6, or 11 observations and recomputed the confidence-accuracy correlations.</p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7p0stqqr6nj2k7n/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2014.46.02.png"></p>

<p>The good news is that there are no big changes. Most items get at least 10 <i>remember</i> responses and most also get 5 <i>know</i> responses. Most items also get 1 <i>guess</i> response. Regardless of the number of items which are taken out, too, the confidence-accuracy relationships are remaining steady.</p>

<p>Here's the SPSS matrix when we leave everything in, for future reference:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dhlzla80gfqyhph/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2014.25.19.png"></p>

<p>(Just ignore the crosstabs for the comparisons that aren't relevant. Focus on the diagonals.)</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/24/lightReadingsInTheApartment.html">Light readings in the apartment</a></div>
		<p>Another little side project: I rigged together an Arduino, an Ethernet Shield, and a photometer in the apartment. You can take a look at the code -- mostly spliced together through different tutorials -- <a href="https://github.com/kadesoto/Arduino-Ethernet-Project">on my Github</a>. It takes a reading of the light in the apartment every 15 seconds and uploads it to Xively, which handles the visualization. Here's what it looks like over the last three days:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/uwohs4u1g8b5b6z/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2012.01.48.png"></p>

<p>We see a neat, regular pattern. I'm not exactly sure what the general patterns indicate -- this is all hypothesis at this point -- but we see a peak in the morning when I get ready for work or the day with the lights on and maximum brightness. In fact, I think you can even tell the unit's in a room with eastward facing windows -- a big blast of sun as it rises, followed by a general decrease in light over the day. I think some of the noise is due to different lights that are being turned on and off in the room, but also cloudiness. The third day worth of data is much smoother. I wonder if this means the day was sunnier (i.e., less cloudy) and I messed around less with the lights.</p>

<p>Anything else I ought to test? Eventually, I should move the unit into my office, which has windows that face to the south. I bet you'd find the light pattern to be much more normally distributed.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this? Agree or disagree with my informal analysis?</p>

		<p>A break from your regularly scheduled program -- here's a new entry in Personal Data Friday:</p>

<p>Over the last month I've been using <a href="http://reporter-app.com">Reporter</a>, an experience sampling iPhone app designed by <a href="http://feltron.com">personal analytics czar Nicholas Felton</a> that probes me at random times during my waking hours to determine what I'm up to and who I'm with. Experience sampling is a technique that's been used for a long time in the autobiographical memory literature (e.g., <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/1987/09000/Validity_and_Reliability_of_the.4.aspx">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson, 1987</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>)), so I was excited to find an opportunity to apply the technique to my own life. The idea is that over time, the data recorded at random intervals during the day begins to approximate a clear snapshot of one's entire life. Of course, with a limited handful of data points, this method of estimation may not be particularly accurate. </p>

<p>So, let's take a look at a random sample of daily activities:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zeo73cy5f2gidq8/What%20Doing.png"></p>

<p>You can see I've spent a lot of time working on the computer, but a similar amount of time socializing (hanging out with friends, being with people, etc.). A disappointing amount of my time is spent waiting.</p>

<p>To answer the question "Where are you?" I most often report:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/bnsajvj2xobl1q0/Where%20At.png"></p>

<p>Basically at home or at work. Home beats out the Psychology Building by a fair margin here because I have been working from home a bit more than usual lately. You can see that I haven't spent a significant amount of time anywhere else -- everything else is basically individual observations.</p>

<p>And last but not least, who I'm with:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/1k6d5rjzfannnw9/Who%20With.png"></p>

<p>Lots of alone time, lots of significant other time, then it's down to buddies. Becky and I spend a lot of time together, clearly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I can keep this project up much longer -- it's a little too disruptive to do and I don't like the switch you have to flip to go to bed at the end of the day (I keep forgetting to toggle it, so get polled during sleeping hours by accident). It was a neat project while it lasted, though!</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/20/anotherNeatFinding.html">Another neat finding</a></div>
		<p>In a meeting with Roddy yesterday he suggested I conduct a conceptual replication of an <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/38/2/325/">Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>) study in which the authors showed that <i>know</i> judgments made with high confidence are, on average, more likely to be correct than <i>remember</i> judgments made with lower confidence. This is an interesting finding because it means that <i>remember</i> judgments aren't functionally equivalent to memories held with high confidence. This is stated well in the title of this paper: "Recollection (i.e., as indexed by <i>remember</i> judgments) can be weak and familiarity (as indexed by <i>knows</i>) can be strong."  </p>

<p>So I divided up all "old" recognition decisions by whether they were <i>remembered</i>, <i>known</i>, or <i>guessed</i> and looked at their average accuracy across confidence bins of 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, and 75-100. And here's what we get:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dpy9vcscesbvxmq/Screenshot%202014-03-20%2015.45.23.png"></p>

<p>Sure enough, my findings support the discoveries of Ingram and colleagues. <i>Know</i> judgments made with high (i.e., 76-100) confidence are more likely to be correct than <i>remember</i> judgments made with lower (i.e., 26-50) confidence.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/20/redoingAFigure.html">Redoing a figure</a></div>
		<p>Every once in a while we researchers have the pleasure of recreating a historic or classic figure for reuse in a presentation or paper. It's a zenlike experience to engage in this process of re-transcription. Today's mission was to redo Figure 1 from <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/64/5/482/">a 1962 paper by Bennet Murdock</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>) on the serial position curve in memory.</p>

<p>Here's the original figure...</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/8dy43j9bfdycdyd/Screenshot%202014-03-19%2015.50.09.png"></p>

<p>... and here's my redo.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/g7093qxzwvpmgi0/Screenshot%202014-03-20%2011.02.11.png"></p>

<p>Although the new figure is much more flexible (can be edited, etc.) and vector rather than raster (can be resized, reshaped, etc., without loss of quality), there's a real elegance to the original figure. In particular, I bumped into issues recreating the "shiny" bubbles of the 20-1 condition in the original, so I had to settle for a less interesting (but perhaps more readable) intermediate gray shade. Additionally, it's not so easy to create those "legend arrows" from the original, so I stuck with a more traditional legend.</p>

<p>What did the original figure creator get right? What did he or she get wrong? I was about to assume the figure was Murdock's work, but it occurred to me that the journal typesetter or editor may have created the figure. I think I have seen similar figures in papers by other authors, but am not certain.</p>

<p>P.S.: I utilize a feature of Fargo, my outlining system, for the first time in this post. Above, I link to Murdock's paper but, like so many other academic works, it's behind a paywall. In order to indicate this, I enter a little tag I invented myself -- [ paywall ] -- and Fargo renders a dollar sign icon. Later today I'll link the icon to some information about paywalls.   </p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/19/gammaCorrelationsContinued.html">Gamma correlations, continued</a></div>
		<p>So yesterday I calculated the within-subject gamma correlations for <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> responses. I finished the work this morning and now know the within-<i>item</i> correlations for <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> responses. Just like for the within-subject correlations, the within-item correlations are higher for <i>remember</i> responses (M = .57, SD = .42), intermediate for <i>know</i> responses (M = .41, SD = .36), and lowest for <i>guesses</i> (M = .05, SD = .58). This is significant as per a repeated-measures ANOVA, <i>F</i>(2, 314) = 69.07, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, and corresponding post-hoc tests.</p>

<p>Here's the SPSS printout of the figure: </p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/83wtl91isfej60x/Screenshot%202014-03-19%2012.20.28.png"></p>

<p>It turns out that the <a href="http://technimentis.com/2014/03/18/gammaCorrelationsForDissertationWorkOtherNotes.html">correlations reported yesterday are statistically significant, too</a>. The repeated-measures ANOVA was significant, <i>F</i>(2, 96) = 12.86, <i>p</i> &lt; .001.</p>

<p>What are the implications? More to come.</p>

		<p>Brain's a little blurry today. I attempted (with mixed success) a 20-mile training run this morning that I'm still recovering from. Here's the route:</p>

<p>Today my research efforts were spent on obtaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodman_and_Kruskal's_gamma">gamma correlations</a> for subjects in my dissertation project. 3-18-14 Data.xlsx contains these numbers. There's not much to look at here, so we can just summarize them by saying that average gamma for <i>remember</i> responses (<i>M</i> = .47, <i>SD</i> = .49) appears numerically greater than average gamma for <i>know</i> responses (<i>M</i> = .26, <i>SD</i> = .33), and those appear greater than gamma for <i>guess </i>responses (<i>M</i> = .08, <i>SD</i> = .28). I haven't run the within-subjects ANOVA yet so I can't tell you whether these differences are significant. Do note that there's a lot of variability here, as illustrated by the standard deviations. To show you what I'm talking about, here are the correlations for the <i>remember</i> responses, for each subject:</p>

<p>(Of course, the negative -1.00's pop out here as something we might want to investigate in the future.)</p>

<p>I was conducting a similar analysis for the item-level gammas but ran into an issue when sanitizing the data file. Looking at these numbers, unfortunately, will have to wait for tomorrow.</p>

<p>One unrelated note: <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/outliners-as-a-tool-for-open-science">I submitted a Knight News Challenge fellowship proposal for a project using Fargo</a>. You can take a look at the proposal here. I speak about the idea casually (note that a lot of the verbiage was copied and pasted into the fellowship proposal -- shh, don't tell) <a href="http://technimentis.com/2014/02/27/fargoForOpenScienceDocumentation.html">in an earlier blog post here</a>. </p>

		<p>Getting back into the swing of things this Monday. Last week was spring break here at WUSTL, so I worked from home a bunch and got some professional development-related things going for a change of pace. I was expecting to segue back into my more usual work when I got sidelined with a weird bug (perhaps from something I ate Friday night?) and was on my back all weekend as a result. My brain is only now starting to clear up.</p>

<p>Some neat links for the day: <a href="http://modnotebooks.com/">These things called Mod Notebooks</a> -- you pay $25, get a notebook in the mail, and then ship it in when it's filled and they digitize it for you. On one hand $25 seems pretty low (especially considering a traditional Moleskine's worth least half that without the digitization included). But on the other hand it seems much more useful to get something digitized on a daily basis. Once I fill up a notebook, what are the chances I'm going to want to go back and look at it?</p>

<p>Also, if you're interested in <a href="http://freebracketchallenge.1.mayhem.cbssports.com/brackets/shareable-bracket/14a104376ee688f579c2a2c0fd637ff1a5c0b907910f2e99?randkey=142407">my March Madness bracket, come on and get me right here</a>.</p>

<p>I spent the morning working on a review for a journal article I received over the weekend. I can't say much about it here but will share it around if and when it's published. Reading through I was reminded just how hard it can be to write a good paper. It's such a particular challenge to keep the overall goal of a manuscript in mind (e.g., the main thesis, how sections connect to each other) at the same time you keep the underlying facts accurate and concise. Writing really is a balancing act.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is getting my head back into my dissertation, which I've taken a break from the last few days. It's helpful going back to look at some of my previous posts <a href="http://technimentis.com/2014/02/28/investigatingConfidenceaccuracyCorrelations.html">(1)</a>, <a href="http://technimentis.com/2014/03/03/updatedLogisticRegressionAnalyses.html">(2)</a> to refresh my memory. The next step is seeing if any critical elements are missing from my prior analyses and then going forward with the proposed Experiment 3.</p>

<p>(Last note -- you might have noticed that this site is now hosted on my <a href="http://technimentis.com/">Technimentis</a> domain. I've always felt this is the right place for documenting and writing about my research.) </p>
