		<p>My acquaintance <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/walt-hickey/">Walter Hickey</a>, from FiveThirtyEight, made an interesting comment that I wanted to address in over 140 characters.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/becky_koenig">@becky_koenig</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kadesoto">@kadesoto</a> also, readers, commenters and other publications are almost certainly more grilling than a peer review.</p>&mdash; Walter Hickey (@WaltHickey) <a href="https://twitter.com/WaltHickey/statuses/453984414687821826">April 9, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>It's an interesting idea to think about. At face value the idea makes sense -- a million people out there, any number of which have the time, energy, and expertise to evaluate your writing critically. But I'm not sure the evidence is out there suggesting that people actually do that. When I read critiques of news articles, they seem partisan or opinion based -- "I think this article is wrong because I disagree with you." Peer review, at its best, does more than this. Readers and commenters will be quick to pick up on and take down obvious flaws and logical fallacies. But can you count on them to investigate statistical analyses, interpretations of scientific theory? Do your readers know how to bootstrap, score psychological measures, or do a shift of benchwork?</p>

<p>A few of them do, but it's irresponsible to assume that those people are out there and are willing and motivated to clean up any mistakes you made. Scientific peer review, despite its faults, ensures that at least some wise brains have the professional responsibility to evaluate your arguments. Ideally, it matches up subject matter experts -- people who <i>can</i> bootstrap and evaluate theory, to continue the example -- to papers that require it.</p>

<p>Data journalists would be wise to seek out impartial reviewers instead of assuming that readers, commenters, and other publications will do the job of ensuring accuracy for them.</p>

		<p>So more for my notes than anything else, here's a figure that shows the number of times subjects say <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> with varying levels of confidence.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/02wxlmogk9z5djz/Screenshot%202014-04-08%2014.22.37.png" alt="Figure" width="" height="" border="" align=""> </p>

<p>You can see that there's an overwhelming number of maximum confidence <i>remember</i> responses. These responses are made with confidence ratings of 90 to 100. Some take this as evidence that the phenomenon of <i>remembering</i> is all-or-none -- perhaps the observations of <i>remember</i> assigned lower confidence values are just noise.</p>

		<p>My dissertation research is turning out to be somewhat timely -- a colleague of mine in the Behavior, Brain, and Cognition program recently gave a brief talk for the department reporting that she wasn't able to find some of the results reported in another paper (one relevant to my dissertation). I suppose it's not quite my place to talk about it here, so I'll just attach the figure, for my own reference, that adds to the discussion:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/b1bo9lhq8jxng0y/Screenshot%202014-04-03%2012.59.40.png" alt="Replication of Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)" width="" height="" border="" align=""> </p>

<p>If you want to know more, you can e-mail me directly.</p>

<p>This interesting issue raises a larger point that I have been concerned about for a few weeks now. To what extent is a fellow researcher authorized to discuss research presented in department talks and colloquia? What is the best way to cover topics discussed in these sessions? Traditionally, researchers discuss data that are in progress or have not been finalized, published, or sometimes even double-checked. At the same time, though, it's rare to hear a presenter warn, "Please don't tell others about this research until it has been published." So what is the appropriate way to share an interesting talk you've heard? Do you only discuss work that has been published, as a ground rule? Do you speak about unpublished research, but in a vague way? Do you assume that if the research has been presented in a public talk, it's fair game? Is there a difference when research is presented in a lab meeting versus a brown bag versus a department talk?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone older and wiser than me can share their opinions.</p>

		<p>Getting around to reading this neat review of the <i>remember/know</i> procedure written by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001298">Migo, Mayes, and Montaldi (2012)</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>). It covers some interesting issues in the use of <i>remember/know</i> judgments as well as some best practices. Here are some assorted notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>p. 1437: A messy figure good for showing the complicated confidence/<i>RKG</i>/memory interrelationships</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1439: Distinctions between <i>remember/know</i> and source memory tasks</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1441: The beginning of a helpful section relating <i>remember/know</i> to confidence</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1442: Citation to Smith, Wixted, and Squire (2011), which I should add to the reading list</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1443: Discussion of how "false recollection" can be due to "true," yet mis-connected, recollections</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The authors also outline some valuable guidelines for working with <i>RKG</i> judgments in the laboratory:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Include the exact instructions in the manuscript</p></li>
<li><p>Describe any instruction checks used during the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>Describe any instruction checks used after the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>Declare any rules for elimination or replacing of subjects</p></li>
<li><p>Include "the measurement assumption used to calculate familiarity performance" (p. 1446)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these are self-evident, but it's good to see them in print. Later on (p. 1446) there's a discussion of how the Rajaram (1993) instructions suggest that <i>know</i> responses can only be made when a subject is certain an item was presented. This isn't true, and Montaldi et al. (2006) discusses this further.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>p. 1448: An interesting suggestion that subjects who have <i>remember</i> rates over 50% should be excluded</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1449: A recommendation against using <i>guess</i> responses -- oops!</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1449: Some criticisms of Ingram et al. (2012), which my work is partially inspired by</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, a valuable article that'll be added to the project folder.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/31/morePersonalDataTrackingNetCalories.html">More personal data tracking: Net calories</a></div>
		<p>I went out with some friends on Friday night and was surprised to get at least four comments, from people I don't talk to on a regular basis, about my updates (which most come across via Facebook). The gist of the comments is that my updates seemed frequent, but not yet to the point of irritation -- at least I hope! -- and occasionally even a little interesting. Hannah gave some good feedback and said she wanted to see a little more personal data, so I'll oblige -- direct any complaints to her!</p>

<p>Her first note that it would be good to see some mood and psychological wellbeing data. I haven't collected any of that yet, so I decided to start. I signed up for the Track Your Happiness project -- which I've done before -- and <a href="http://trackyourhappiness.org">which you can do here</a>. More on that when I get to it.</p>

<p>But in the meantime I thought I would present some data on nutrition and calories (another suggested topic), in case it's a area of interest. Here is a <i>rough</i> approximation of my net calories consumed since January 1. This figure represents the amount I've eaten in a day minus any exercise I've done (the red line is my rough total expenditure for a given day without any exercise):</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/npruzf2tcmn3btq/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.42.19.png"></p>

<p>Like many of us I started the new year off with a diet but also a marathon training plan (I'm a firm believer in the strategy of "over-promise and under-deliver"). The general upward trend in net calories suggests that the diet has tapered off as the amount of running has increased. Around February 23 or so, I upped things even more (and as a result have been less conscientious about tracking such things).   </p>

<p>We can compare this figure with total calories (or maybe we should call this "gross calories"?):</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nycrwekebk5rs6z/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.55.02.png"></p>

<p>Make any comparisons you like, I suppose!</p>

<p>One final note: Of course this tracking is imprecise and most likely underestimates intake significantly (and never overestimates). So things may look a little stricter than they actually were.</p>

<p>Here's hoping this is interesting somehow!</p>

		<p>I've been writing about my dissertation research here for a while now, but of course it makes very little sense getting these updates <i>in media res</i>. I've held off on writing an introductory post because doing so would take too many words and would not be all too fun to read. </p>

<p>So I decided: Why not do a brief audio post on it, instead, so you can get caught up if you like?</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/z07e6fn6ys41ju1/15%20Intro.mp3">Take a listen</a>. It's a 12 minute recording. I hope to get better at these things as time goes on. </p>

<p>If you get a chance to listen in, I would love to get some comments and questions.</p>

<p>I've also added a link to the podcast on the project overview page -- <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a>.</p>

		<p>I have a few free minutes today, so I've been spending some time learning how to use Python for statistical programming. It is not a friendly learning curve so far. <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">I started by installing Anaconda</a>, a package that includes, as far as I can tell, everything you need to get started. <a href="http://ipython.org/">Once I did that I got IPython running</a>, which is -- again, as far as I can tell -- a browser-based client for doing stats in Python.</p>

<p>Then I mostly followed a tutorial that assumed I knew <i>way</i> more than I actually did.</p>

<p>A neat feature I discovered is that <a href="http://ipython.org/">you can use the IPython Notebook Viewer to share your statistics with others</a>. <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/Basics.ipynb.json?create=1">Click on this link here to see the stats that I ran</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that I conducted a t-test, and a one-way ANOVA! On what, that's a good question, but at least I executed those steps.</p>

<p>So clearly, here's what I need to learn in order to get useful at this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to take data off of my webservers and get them into IPython</p></li>
<li><p>Run basic t-tests and ANOVAs with said data</p></li>
<li><p>Do correlation and regression analyses with said data</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things sound <i>too</i> difficult -- rather, it's the conditional analyzing, etc. (e.g., averaging across subjects -- how does one do this?) -- that'll be challenging to learn.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips, tricks, or good places to get started, feel free to share them.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/24/examiningItemCharacteristics.html">Examining item characteristics</a></div>
		<p>So, in my dissertation work, subjects study some items and take a test on studied and unstudied items. When subjects indicate an item was "old," or previously studied, they judge whether they <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, or <i>guess </i>that the item is old. <i>Remember</i> responses are provided when subjects can mentally recollect the moment of the item's occurrence in the list. <i>Know</i> responses are made when subjects think they saw the item on the list but can't recollect presentation details. Last, subjects are told to make a <i>guess </i>response when they're just guessing.</p>

<p>It also happens that the items are categorized words that vary in terms of <i>response frequency</i>, which is a sort of typicality. Common category members (like <i>eagle</i> from the <i>birds</i> category) have a low response frequency (e.g., 1 or 2), whereas less common category members have a high response frequency.</p>

<p>We wondered if subjects might be much more likely to respond <i>remember</i> to a high response frequency item than a low response frequency item, and likewise for <i>know</i> and <i>guess</i>. To investigate I took the average response frequency for each subjects' <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> responses. I divided these into correct responses (i.e., hits) and incorrect responses (i.e., false alarms), and here's what we get:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mqphmtjzwi9zkx6/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2016.09.16.png"></p>

<p>Not much of a difference. I haven't run any significance tests on these data but there's nothing shocking -- in other words, subjects seem equally likely to respond <i>remember</i>, whether correctly or incorrectly, to items of all output dominance values.</p>

<p>Do you agree with my interpretation?</p>

		<p>In our confidence-accuracy relationship research, one analysis we're interested in is called the <i>between-events</i> confidence-accuracy correlation. This between-events analysis describes the extent to which events or items (e.g., words) that are responded to with greater confidence are also more likely to be responded to correctly. My dissertation research aims to obtain between-events correlations (as well as correlations of other types) for items responded to with <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, or <i>guess</i> after an "old" recognition decision (read up on the <i>remember/know</i> procedure for some background here).<i> </i></p>

<p>To get this particular confidence-accuracy correlation, we take each item and get an average confidence and average accuracy for each, then plot the trendline.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that there are some items which only receive a recognition decision of "old" a small number of times in the study. The objective in this analysis was to exclude those items for which only a few "old" responses were given and see if the resulting confidence-accuracy correlations differ dramatically.</p>

<p>To do this, I filtered out items for which there were fewer than 2, 6, or 11 observations and recomputed the confidence-accuracy correlations.</p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p>The good news is that there are no big changes. Most items get at least 10 <i>remember</i> responses and most also get 5 <i>know</i> responses. Most items also get 1 <i>guess</i> response. Regardless of the number of items which are taken out, too, the confidence-accuracy relationships are remaining steady.</p>

<p>Here's the SPSS matrix when we leave everything in, for future reference:</p>

		<p>Another little side project: I rigged together an Arduino, an Ethernet Shield, and a photometer in the apartment. You can take a look at the code -- mostly spliced together through different tutorials -- <a href="https://github.com/kadesoto/Arduino-Ethernet-Project">on my Github</a>. It takes a reading of the light in the apartment every 15 seconds and uploads it to Xively, which handles the visualization. Here's what it looks like over the last three days:</p>

<p>We see a neat, regular pattern. I'm not exactly sure what the general patterns indicate -- this is all hypothesis at this point -- but we see a peak in the morning when I get ready for work or the day with the lights on and maximum brightness. In fact, I think you can even tell the unit's in a room with eastward facing windows -- a big blast of sun as it rises, followed by a general decrease in light over the day. I think some of the noise is due to different lights that are being turned on and off in the room, but also cloudiness. The third day worth of data is much smoother. I wonder if this means the day was sunnier (i.e., less cloudy) and I messed around less with the lights.</p>

<p>Anything else I ought to test? Eventually, I should move the unit into my office, which has windows that face to the south. I bet you'd find the light pattern to be much more normally distributed.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this? Agree or disagree with my informal analysis?</p>
