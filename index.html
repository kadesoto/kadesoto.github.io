		<p>My dissertation research is turning out to be somewhat timely -- a colleague of mine in the Behavior, Brain, and Cognition program recently gave a brief talk for the department reporting that she wasn't able to find some of the results reported in another paper (one relevant to my dissertation). I suppose it's not quite my place to talk about it here, so I'll just attach the figure, for my own reference, that adds to the discussion:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/b1bo9lhq8jxng0y/Screenshot%202014-04-03%2012.59.40.png" alt="Replication of Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)" width="" height="" border="" align="" /> </p>

<p>If you want to know more, you can e-mail me directly.</p>

<p>This interesting issue raises a larger point that I have been concerned about for a few weeks now. To what extent is a fellow researcher authorized to discuss research presented in department talks and colloquia? What is the best way to cover topics discussed in these sessions? Traditionally, researchers discuss data that are in progress or have not been finalized, published, or sometimes even double-checked. At the same time, though, it's rare to hear a presenter warn, "Please don't tell others about this research until it has been published." So what is the appropriate way to share an interesting talk you've heard? Do you only discuss work that has been published, as a ground rule? Do you speak about unpublished research, but in a vague way? Do you assume that if the research has been presented in a public talk, it's fair game? Is there a difference when research is presented in a lab meeting versus a brown bag versus a department talk?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone older and wiser than me can share their opinions.</p>

		<p>Getting around to reading this neat review of the <i>remember/know</i> procedure written by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001298">Migo, Mayes, and Montaldi (2012)</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>). It covers some interesting issues in the use of <i>remember/know</i> judgments as well as some best practices. Here are some assorted notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>p. 1437: A messy figure good for showing the complicated confidence/<i>RKG</i>/memory interrelationships</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1439: Distinctions between <i>remember/know</i> and source memory tasks</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1441: The beginning of a helpful section relating <i>remember/know</i> to confidence</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1442: Citation to Smith, Wixted, and Squire (2011), which I should add to the reading list</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1443: Discussion of how "false recollection" can be due to "true," yet mis-connected, recollections</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The authors also outline some valuable guidelines for working with <i>RKG</i> judgments in the laboratory:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Include the exact instructions in the manuscript</p></li>
<li><p>Describe any instruction checks used during the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>Describe any instruction checks used after the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>Declare any rules for elimination or replacing of subjects</p></li>
<li><p>Include "the measurement assumption used to calculate familiarity performance" (p. 1446)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these are self-evident, but it's good to see them in print. Later on (p. 1446) there's a discussion of how the Rajaram (1993) instructions suggest that <i>know</i> responses can only be made when a subject is certain an item was presented. This isn't true, and Montaldi et al. (2006) discusses this further.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>p. 1448: An interesting suggestion that subjects who have <i>remember</i> rates over 50% should be excluded</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1449: A recommendation against using <i>guess</i> responses -- oops!</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1449: Some criticisms of Ingram et al. (2012), which my work is partially inspired by</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, a valuable article that'll be added to the project folder.</p>

		<p>I went out with some friends on Friday night and was surprised to get at least four comments, from people I don't talk to on a regular basis, about my updates (which most come across via Facebook). The gist of the comments is that my updates seemed frequent, but not yet to the point of irritation -- at least I hope! -- and occasionally even a little interesting. Hannah gave some good feedback and said she wanted to see a little more personal data, so I'll oblige -- direct any complaints to her!</p>

<p>Her first note that it would be good to see some mood and psychological wellbeing data. I haven't collected any of that yet, so I decided to start. I signed up for the Track Your Happiness project -- which I've done before -- and <a href="http://trackyourhappiness.org">which you can do here</a>. More on that when I get to it.</p>

<p>But in the meantime I thought I would present some data on nutrition and calories (another suggested topic), in case it's a area of interest. Here is a <i>rough</i> approximation of my net calories consumed since January 1. This figure represents the amount I've eaten in a day minus any exercise I've done (the red line is my rough total expenditure for a given day without any exercise):</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/npruzf2tcmn3btq/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.42.19.png"></p>

<p>Like many of us I started the new year off with a diet but also a marathon training plan (I'm a firm believer in the strategy of "over-promise and under-deliver"). The general upward trend in net calories suggests that the diet has tapered off as the amount of running has increased. Around February 23 or so, I upped things even more (and as a result have been less conscientious about tracking such things).   </p>

<p>We can compare this figure with total calories (or maybe we should call this "gross calories"?):</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nycrwekebk5rs6z/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.55.02.png"></p>

<p>Make any comparisons you like, I suppose!</p>

<p>One final note: Of course this tracking is imprecise and most likely underestimates intake significantly (and never overestimates). So things may look a little stricter than they actually were.</p>

<p>Here's hoping this is interesting somehow!</p>

		<p>I've been writing about my dissertation research here for a while now, but of course it makes very little sense getting these updates <i>in media res</i>. I've held off on writing an introductory post because doing so would take too many words and would not be all too fun to read. </p>

<p>So I decided: Why not do a brief audio post on it, instead, so you can get caught up if you like?</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/z07e6fn6ys41ju1/15%20Intro.mp3">Take a listen</a>. It's a 12 minute recording. I hope to get better at these things as time goes on. </p>

<p>If you get a chance to listen in, I would love to get some comments and questions.</p>

<p>I've also added a link to the podcast on the project overview page -- <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a>.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/26/learningTheBasicsOfStatsInPython.html">Learning the basics of stats in Python</a></div>
		<p>I have a few free minutes today, so I've been spending some time learning how to use Python for statistical programming. It is not a friendly learning curve so far. <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">I started by installing Anaconda</a>, a package that includes, as far as I can tell, everything you need to get started. <a href="http://ipython.org/">Once I did that I got IPython running</a>, which is -- again, as far as I can tell -- a browser-based client for doing stats in Python.</p>

<p>Then I mostly followed a tutorial that assumed I knew <i>way</i> more than I actually did.</p>

<p>A neat feature I discovered is that <a href="http://ipython.org/">you can use the IPython Notebook Viewer to share your statistics with others</a>. <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/Basics.ipynb.json?create=1">Click on this link here to see the stats that I ran</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that I conducted a t-test, and a one-way ANOVA! On what, that's a good question, but at least I executed those steps.</p>

<p>So clearly, here's what I need to learn in order to get useful at this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to take data off of my webservers and get them into IPython</p></li>
<li><p>Run basic t-tests and ANOVAs with said data</p></li>
<li><p>Do correlation and regression analyses with said data</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things sound <i>too</i> difficult -- rather, it's the conditional analyzing, etc. (e.g., averaging across subjects -- how does one do this?) -- that'll be challenging to learn.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips, tricks, or good places to get started, feel free to share them.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/24/examiningItemCharacteristics.html">Examining item characteristics</a></div>
		<p>So, in my dissertation work, subjects study some items and take a test on studied and unstudied items. When subjects indicate an item was "old," or previously studied, they judge whether they <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, or <i>guess </i>that the item is old. <i>Remember</i> responses are provided when subjects can mentally recollect the moment of the item's occurrence in the list. <i>Know</i> responses are made when subjects think they saw the item on the list but can't recollect presentation details. Last, subjects are told to make a <i>guess </i>response when they're just guessing.</p>

<p>It also happens that the items are categorized words that vary in terms of <i>response frequency</i>, which is a sort of typicality. Common category members (like <i>eagle</i> from the <i>birds</i> category) have a low response frequency (e.g., 1 or 2), whereas less common category members have a high response frequency.</p>

<p>We wondered if subjects might be much more likely to respond <i>remember</i> to a high response frequency item than a low response frequency item, and likewise for <i>know</i> and <i>guess</i>. To investigate I took the average response frequency for each subjects' <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> responses. I divided these into correct responses (i.e., hits) and incorrect responses (i.e., false alarms), and here's what we get:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mqphmtjzwi9zkx6/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2016.09.16.png"></p>

<p>Not much of a difference. I haven't run any significance tests on these data but there's nothing shocking -- in other words, subjects seem equally likely to respond <i>remember</i>, whether correctly or incorrectly, to items of all output dominance values.</p>

<p>Do you agree with my interpretation?</p>

		<p>In our confidence-accuracy relationship research, one analysis we're interested in is called the <i>between-events</i> confidence-accuracy correlation. This between-events analysis describes the extent to which events or items (e.g., words) that are responded to with greater confidence are also more likely to be responded to correctly. My dissertation research aims to obtain between-events correlations (as well as correlations of other types) for items responded to with <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, or <i>guess</i> after an "old" recognition decision (read up on the <i>remember/know</i> procedure for some background here).<i> </i></p>

<p>To get this particular confidence-accuracy correlation, we take each item and get an average confidence and average accuracy for each, then plot the trendline.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that there are some items which only receive a recognition decision of "old" a small number of times in the study. The objective in this analysis was to exclude those items for which only a few "old" responses were given and see if the resulting confidence-accuracy correlations differ dramatically.</p>

<p>To do this, I filtered out items for which there were fewer than 2, 6, or 11 observations and recomputed the confidence-accuracy correlations.</p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7p0stqqr6nj2k7n/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2014.46.02.png"></p>

<p>The good news is that there are no big changes. Most items get at least 10 <i>remember</i> responses and most also get 5 <i>know</i> responses. Most items also get 1 <i>guess</i> response. Regardless of the number of items which are taken out, too, the confidence-accuracy relationships are remaining steady.</p>

<p>Here's the SPSS matrix when we leave everything in, for future reference:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dhlzla80gfqyhph/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2014.25.19.png"></p>

<p>(Just ignore the crosstabs for the comparisons that aren't relevant. Focus on the diagonals.)</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="2014/03/24/lightReadingsInTheApartment.html">Light readings in the apartment</a></div>
		<p>Another little side project: I rigged together an Arduino, an Ethernet Shield, and a photometer in the apartment. You can take a look at the code -- mostly spliced together through different tutorials -- <a href="https://github.com/kadesoto/Arduino-Ethernet-Project">on my Github</a>. It takes a reading of the light in the apartment every 15 seconds and uploads it to Xively, which handles the visualization. Here's what it looks like over the last three days:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/uwohs4u1g8b5b6z/Screenshot%202014-03-24%2012.01.48.png"></p>

<p>We see a neat, regular pattern. I'm not exactly sure what the general patterns indicate -- this is all hypothesis at this point -- but we see a peak in the morning when I get ready for work or the day with the lights on and maximum brightness. In fact, I think you can even tell the unit's in a room with eastward facing windows -- a big blast of sun as it rises, followed by a general decrease in light over the day. I think some of the noise is due to different lights that are being turned on and off in the room, but also cloudiness. The third day worth of data is much smoother. I wonder if this means the day was sunnier (i.e., less cloudy) and I messed around less with the lights.</p>

<p>Anything else I ought to test? Eventually, I should move the unit into my office, which has windows that face to the south. I bet you'd find the light pattern to be much more normally distributed.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this? Agree or disagree with my informal analysis?</p>

		<p>A break from your regularly scheduled program -- here's a new entry in Personal Data Friday:</p>

<p>Over the last month I've been using <a href="http://reporter-app.com">Reporter</a>, an experience sampling iPhone app designed by <a href="http://feltron.com">personal analytics czar Nicholas Felton</a> that probes me at random times during my waking hours to determine what I'm up to and who I'm with. Experience sampling is a technique that's been used for a long time in the autobiographical memory literature (e.g., <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/1987/09000/Validity_and_Reliability_of_the.4.aspx">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson, 1987</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>)), so I was excited to find an opportunity to apply the technique to my own life. The idea is that over time, the data recorded at random intervals during the day begins to approximate a clear snapshot of one's entire life. Of course, with a limited handful of data points, this method of estimation may not be particularly accurate. </p>

<p>So, let's take a look at a random sample of daily activities:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zeo73cy5f2gidq8/What%20Doing.png"></p>

<p>You can see I've spent a lot of time working on the computer, but a similar amount of time socializing (hanging out with friends, being with people, etc.). A disappointing amount of my time is spent waiting.</p>

<p>To answer the question "Where are you?" I most often report:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/bnsajvj2xobl1q0/Where%20At.png"></p>

<p>Basically at home or at work. Home beats out the Psychology Building by a fair margin here because I have been working from home a bit more than usual lately. You can see that I haven't spent a significant amount of time anywhere else -- everything else is basically individual observations.</p>

<p>And last but not least, who I'm with:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/1k6d5rjzfannnw9/Who%20With.png"></p>

<p>Lots of alone time, lots of significant other time, then it's down to buddies. Becky and I spend a lot of time together, clearly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I can keep this project up much longer -- it's a little too disruptive to do and I don't like the switch you have to flip to go to bed at the end of the day (I keep forgetting to toggle it, so get polled during sleeping hours by accident). It was a neat project while it lasted, though!</p>

		<p>In a meeting with Roddy yesterday he suggested I conduct a conceptual replication of an <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/38/2/325/">Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>) study in which the authors showed that <i>know</i> judgments made with high confidence are, on average, more likely to be correct than <i>remember</i> judgments made with lower confidence. This is an interesting finding because it means that <i>remember</i> judgments aren't functionally equivalent to memories held with high confidence. This is stated well in the title of this paper: "Recollection (i.e., as indexed by <i>remember</i> judgments) can be weak and familiarity (as indexed by <i>knows</i>) can be strong."  </p>

<p>So I divided up all "old" recognition decisions by whether they were <i>remembered</i>, <i>known</i>, or <i>guessed</i> and looked at their average accuracy across confidence bins of 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, and 75-100. And here's what we get:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dpy9vcscesbvxmq/Screenshot%202014-03-20%2015.45.23.png"></p>

<p>Sure enough, my findings support the discoveries of Ingram and colleagues. <i>Know</i> judgments made with high (i.e., 76-100) confidence are more likely to be correct than <i>remember</i> judgments made with lower (i.e., 26-50) confidence.</p>
