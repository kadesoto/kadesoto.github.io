		<p>Met to discuss Experiment 2 of <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a> and showed off a lot of the figures I've been working on over the last few weeks. We agreed it was time to go ahead and progress beyond the pilot phase and collect another 52 subjects' worth of data. I'll see if any lab members are available to assist with the data collection, but I hope to complete it in February. Could be tough -- that is almost three people per day for the month -- but I think we can do it.</p>

<p>Some recommendations I got or we talked about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I should check to see if the relatively high guess rate for related lures (<i>M</i> = .14) is in the auditory or visual condition (or both).</p></li>
<li><p>I should also keep a careful eye out for the number of observations in different cells, and perhaps show these in figures and tables where the concern applies.</p></li>
<li><p>I could use items as the method of analysis in the proportion of <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess </i>tables<i>.</i></p></li>
<li><p>I need to think more about what the confidence-accuracy plots actually mean when we subdivide by remember, know, and guess. Being able to explain these plots -- and really dig into them -- is going to be a critical part of the dissertation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also briefly discussed "media strategy" for <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/21/0956797613516149">DeSoto and Roediger (2014)</a> <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/articles/DeSoto%20%26%20Roediger%20%282014%29.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file-o"></i></a> and whether I'll be able to get help from any undergraduate students over the next few months.</p>

<p>Last, I just opened 75 slots on Experimetrix. We'll see who we get next week. I'd better make sure my study is rock solid! </p>

		<p>I just finished something relatively uninteresting: Repackaging many of the figures <a href="http://beta.fargo.io/users/desoto/2014/01/index.html">I've shared over the last month</a> so Roddy and I can talk about them at our meeting. Doing this reminded me of a thought I've had several times before: It is a shame that researchers must use two-dimensional mediums like tables and figures to represent a set of data. Thinking about data would be much easier if you could control analyses via natural language processing. For instance, you say to your Excel file, "Show me the false alarm rate for the word 'cardinal' in Experiment 1" and the number pops up -- boom, 0.19. Instead what you have to when discussing data is think of every possible way folks will want to consider the dataset and construct a table or figure for each way. That's not very convenient, especially when 90% of them will eventually go unused!</p>

<p>(Something like <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> for personal use or personal datasets would be close to what I'm thinking about.)</p>

<p>Oh well, give it five or 10 years and maybe we'll be there.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="28/someInitialThoughtsAboutGoogleGlass.html">Some initial thoughts about Google Glass</a></div>
		<p>I've had a tangerine-colored pair of Google Glass for five days now and thought I would share some initial impressions.</p>

<p>Downside: First, although I'm platform agnostic (psychologically speaking), I am set up in "Apple Land," not "Google World." It is a big change of pace to think of Google Contacts, Hangouts, and Google+ instead of iMessages and iChat. As a result a lot of functionality is unclear to me. If I take a picture and share it with a friend, I have no idea how they're receiving it -- via SMS? through a Hangout? Is it sending an e-mail? It's very strange. I'll text a friend later and ask, "Did you get that picture I sent you?" and most of the times they didn't. Who knows where it went. </p>

<p>Upside: Having something on your face that can take pictures is really cool. Being able to quickly take photos with a wink, a button press, or a head spasm-plus-voice command is convenient. It's nice to get a natural framing too, so I can show to others: "This is how something looks when I look at it."  </p>

<p>Here's an example -- a photo I took of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis while walking home from the bus stop yesterday. I was bundled up with hat and gloves and didn't need to undo any of that to take a quick picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/dj81t3n8gve4zue/20140127_164009_283.jpg"></p>

<p>Downside: Battery life. I don't understand it and it makes me nervous. It was really awful the first few days but seems to have mellowed out. Maybe it's finished installing updates, Glassware, etc. and is happy just to coexist with me?</p>

<p>Upside: Having a Bluetooth headset. This is basic, but I've never made a phone call wirelessly before. Being able to dial someone in my pocket and speak to them with Google Glass is nice. Call quality (and reception) has varied, though. The same walk I photographed the Basilica I tried to make a call that dropped several times in a row. I don't know much about Bluetooth but it seems like a relatively fragile medium.</p>

<p>Mixed bag: The looks. Privately, I enjoy my bright orange Google Glass and they remind me of the future. When I go out into the wild world, though, I have no idea what everyone's thinking. (Well, I know what they're thinking!) A photo of the author as a Glasshole:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/h2n37etbtjq8vkh/20140125_204829_679.jpg"></p>

<p>Downside: As an iPhone user I feel the functionality is quite limited. It costs an arm and a leg to tether (and it's not something I can even do with my current mobile data plan -- AT&amp;T with unlimited data). Which means the thing sits inert on my face for most of the time, eventually bugging my ears.</p>

<p>Upside: There is something strangely natural and reassuring about a face-mounted display. This sounds ridiculous, but even after a few days it feels natural to have them on -- almost comfortable. It's a form factor that seems goofy to an outsider but maybe isn't so strange after all. I guess as someone who has worn glasses since third grade, it's not that out there.</p>

<p>Downside: Terrified about what would happen if I brought them into the bathroom by accident.</p>

		<p><a href="http://beta.fargo.io/users/desoto/2014/01/27/dissertation15Analyses.html" target="_blank">Continuing from where I left off yesterday. </a></p>

<p>I looked at the correlation between false alarm rate and response frequency, like we did in the <i>Psychological Science</i> paper. The figure looks exactly like I'd expect it to (if anything, the correlation is a little weak).</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/oj2tl1yewefzi47/Screenshot%202014-01-28%2009.43.53.png"></p>

<p>I also tried to look at false <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> responses as a function of response frequency and it was pretty messy. I think I need more power in order to look at those functions.</p>

<p>More concerning, though, are the between-event confidence-accuracy correlations from yesterday. Remember that there were lots of values at the ceiling and the floor (refer to the figure from yesterday if you like). Because I've included unrelated lures in that analysis -- which were never studied by anyone -- I have data points in there that would never ever come off the floor. Specifically, any <i>R</i>, <i>K</i>, or <i>G </i>response to an unrelated lure would be located at the point (confidence, 0). So the solution is to recompute the confidence-accuracy relation for these items omitting unrelated lures. And when I do that, the results aren't quite as pretty as they were yesterday -- dang.</p>

<p>Here are those updated figures:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/sb8j9jqkopmz4g8/Screenshot%202014-01-28%2011.09.33.png"></p>

<p>Without doing any stats, the correlation for <i>remembered </i>items (<i>r</i> = .24) appears similar to the correlation for <i>known</i> items (<i>r</i> = .25). Both, though, are better than the correlation for items that are <i>guessed </i>(<i>r</i> = .03).</p>

<p>As you can see in this figure, making this change pulls a lot of points off the floor, especially for <i>remember </i>responses. This hasn't happened yet for <i>K </i>and <i>G</i> -- I am reasonably certain this is a power thing. (Reasonably.)</p>

		<p>Working on analyses for Experiment 2 of my dissertation. I have 12 subjects' worth of pilot data that I'm investigating today to ensure there's nothing funky going on with my data collection, task, and so forth. So what I'm looking at is very basic stuff -- i.e., mean-level -- just to make sure nothing is going astray.</p>

<p>Here are two tables that indicate the frequency with which subjects say "old" to the three different types of items in the study and the confidence with which they offer those "old" responses. That's on the left. On the right, I show the likelihood with which people say "remember," "know," and "guess" to the different item types.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/c6pwff1pa7y2k2y/Screenshot%202014-01-27%2014.47.40.png"></p>

<p>Looking at these tables alerts me that I could make yet a third one showing confidence for "remember," "know," and "guess." I'll do that in just a minute, although it's likely that they'll show anything unsurprising.</p>

<p>Here's that table. A possible three-way interaction?</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/2pm68v09cnkye19/Screenshot%202014-01-27%2015.19.19.png"></p>

<p>Next I have scatterplots depicting the between-events (top) and between-subjects (bottom) confidence-accuracy correlations. First we see a lot of ceiling and floor data for the between-events plots. This is expected because when we collapse across items, there really aren't a lot of subjects to drive variability. This would look a lot better with five or 10 times as many subjects.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/statsphotos/rkgfigures.png"></p>

<p><i>(Note: I noticed a small issue with the between-subjects figures that I've corrected in a later version -- does not change the conclusions, though.)</i></p>

<p>The bottom looks great, though. Subject-level confidence-accuracy plots are low on points but seem to have plenty of variability, which means we can trust the resulting Pearson correlations.</p>

<p>And what are those Pearson correlations, you might ask? Exactly what I was hoping. The confidence-accuracy relation for <i>remembered</i> items (<i>r</i> = .54) is higher than the relation for <i>known</i> items (<i>r</i> = .28) is higher than the relation for <i>guessed</i> items (<i>r</i> = .07) from a between-events perspective.</p>

<p>The same relation holds between subjects: The correlation for <i>remembered</i> items (<i>r</i> = .91) > the correlation for <i>known</i> items (<i>r</i> = .65) > the correlation for <i>guessed </i>items (<i>r</i> = .56)<i>.</i></p>

<p>So far, it's a really nice dataset and will look better with the full contingent of subjects.</p>

<p>This all lives in "1-27-14 Data.xlsx."</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="27/reviewedAPaper.html">Reviewed a paper and a science fair project</a></div>
		<p>Spent some time last Friday and this morning reviewing a submission to <i>Psychology &amp; Neuroscience</i>, which I believe is primarily a Brazilian journal (thanks for finding me, guys). I'll bring it up again if I see it in print over the next few months. It's nice seeing the degree to which findings in the U.S. hold up in other countries.  </p>

<p>Also, I spent a few minutes looking over an empirical project on memory an acquaintance of mine is working on for his ninth grade science fair project. It is a neat project and I'm glad to have been involved (to a small degree) during the research process. Perhaps I'll be able to talk about the project in more detail at a later date, too.</p>

		<p>I met with Jason today to get a sanity check on some of the dissertation (<a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a>) work I've been up to lately. He suggests everything's looking good so far. It's important to visualize my data first through use of scatterplots, etc. Then, I should perhaps separate analyses by <i>remember/know/guess</i> and conduct "simple" logistic regression on the confidence-accuracy relationships. Then you can compare beta weights via t-tests.</p>

<p>You can do this for each subject and average the betas, or you can just get one big equation. Given the data it's probably the case you'd need to average.</p>

<p>If not, we get into the land of multilevel modeling or linear mixed modeling. These methods are able to account for differences among subjects but deal with issues of missing data.</p>

		<p>It was a bit of an "Andy show" today as most of the things we talked about I am involved with. Here's a list of things to do.</p>

<p>There's a misspelling of an author's name on p. 9 of the Jacoby Festschrift chapter draft.  </p>

<p>I should do a little Googling to see if I can find any documentation about the case in Dallas (possibly) where someone was accused of a rape but looked practically identical to the guy who actually committed the crime.</p>

<p>I'll be on the lookout for a cartoon involving penguins from the newspaper a few days ago.</p>

<p>An important takeaway message from the chapter: "Under most natural conditions, there's a tight link between confidence and accuracy in memory. When anomalies occur, though -- that's when problems arise."</p>

<p>In future work, we might want to think about depicting our data using calibration curves. When designing double calibration curves -- <a href="http://tmp.fargo.io/users/desoto/2014/01/14/puzzlingOverCalibrationCurves.html">like the one shown here</a> -- we can divide by old and new or also divide by "old" or "new."</p>

<p>In Table 2 of the chapter, perhaps indicate that the third column represents <i>means</i> of correlations</p>

<p>Last, it's possible that through the use of linear mixed modeling (or multilevel linear modeling) you could also predict the confidence-accuracy relationship.</p>

<p>One more thing -- take a look at the presidents data for people that did not remember Obama?</p>

		<p>I've spent most of my time and energy today trying to fit forgetting functions to one of my datasets. Research (e.g., <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40062717">Wixted &amp; Ebbesen, 1991</a>) suggests that the power function (i.e., <i>y </i>= <i>at^-b</i>) best describes forgetting from memory. I am not experienced in fitting these functions, though, so I had Excel draw power function trendlines through my data and just copied the resulting numbers. I am not super confident that I'm getting the right ones, though, so I really need to take things to a statistical package. Problem is, I don't know which one is right for the job.</p>

<p>Plus, Adam brought up a good point when we spoke today: The data that I am trying to fit might involve a special case in which the power function (or really any function that drops off steeply after <i>t</i> = 0) might not best describe the underlying psychological mechanism I am exploring.</p>

<p>It's really neat taking a look at forgetting for different items, though. Here's a vague, unlabeled figure so you can get a sense of what I'm talking about! I hope to be able to discuss some of these details with you soon.</p>

<p>Time for me to take a break and focus on some other work, I think.</p>

		<p>Not technically a research note, but today I ordered a tangerine-colored Google Glass that should arrive in a few days. It's not really a purchase I can afford (not being a developer, there's not much of a financial incentive reason to get one), so I imagine it'll be going back within the 30-day return window.</p>

<p>I don't consider myself a "Glasshole," so I'm nervous about the social repercussions of wearing them around and about -- not to mention safety (can I wear them on a bus? jogging around the neighborhood?) -- so it'll be interesting, if not a little anxiety inducing, to play around with them for a few days. Maybe it won't be as bad as I'm imagining, especially on the campus of an elite private school where everyone and their mother has a top-of-the-line Macbook Pro.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, if you'd like to play around with them for a little bit, come see me in a week or so. And if you see me with them on, please aim the rocks at my cushy bits and not my face. I can afford the doctor's bill but definitely can't afford the Glass replacement.</p>

<p>But -- can anyone think of any interesting memory studies to be done with them? If so, now is the time to hit me up.</p>
