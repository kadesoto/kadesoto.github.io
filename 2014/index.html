		<p>The last few weeks I've been spending a lot of time on a top-secret project and professional development-type things, so there hasn't been too much to discuss in research notes. The good news, though, is that (I believe) data collection is completed for the third experiment of my dissertation. We have 64 subjects, evenly balanced in terms of counterbalancing condition.</p>

<p>I've not done much in the way of analysis on these data but one thing I'm looking at is whether the general pattern of results replicate what I've discussed in earlier places. So far it looks as if this is the case, which is good to see.</p>

<p>(A few seconds ago I refreshed my Twitter page to see that a <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2014/07/29/aiming-for-an-a-study-habits-you-should-adopt-and-avoid/">USA Today post is out about a recent study techniques review</a>. Strangely, no link to the original article is included. I can't find one either in a few minutes of searching.)</p>

<p>One thing I've been working on in free time is the Data Science specialization track offered through Coursera and Johns Hopkins. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripBottom">You might find it interesting, too</a>.</p>

<p>Hope to have interesting things here myself over the next few days.</p>

		<p>Data collection is going well. There's no longer a need for 50-59 year olds, as you can see from the figure below:</p>

<p>Now, the slow wait for those 60 and up begins. We are getting about seven a day, assuming the rate between the 21st and today remains constant, so I expect this step should take a little over a week. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I also ought to be considering those indicating they cheated on the test. We have 23 self-identified cheaters out of 480 subjects, which is roughly a rate of one in 20 -- not great. I'll have to decide whether to re-run an equivalent number of subjects or just leave it be (likely, I'll just leave it be).</p>

<p>This is more a note for myself than for anything else.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="05/08/recognitionMemoryVsSourceMemoryCalibrationCurves.html">Recognition memory vs. source memory calibration curves</a></div>
		<p>A few days ago I posted some calibration curves for <i>remembering</i>, <i>knowing</i>, and <i>guessing</i>. (It turns out they were constructed from pilot data instead of the full data set accidentally, but the same pattern bears out). In the third experiment of my dissertation -- I have 32 of 64 subjects' worth of data collected so far -- we get both recognition (old/new) accuracy and source accuracy and thus are able to plot two calibration plots, one for recognition and one for source. Take a look.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/9iugg0gsoudt4fu/Screenshot%202014-05-08%2010.47.36.png" alt="Calibration curves" width="" height="" border="" align=""> </p>

<p>They look pretty similar, which is both good and bad news. First note that, at least by eyeball, there's a bigger difference at high confidence (that's the <i>x</i>-axis, which I'm noticing I've left out) for source memory than old/new accuracy for <i>remember</i> versus <i>know</i>. Some prior literature, however, predicts that that <i>know</i> curve for source accuracy should not really be exceeding any point falling on the remember curve. Clearly, though, 80-100 confidence <i>knows</i> are more accurate, in terms of source, than 0-79 confidence <i>remember</i> ratings.</p>

<p>So this is going to be something I have to think about over the next few days. I think it might come down to the instructions. In my study, subjects make a recognition + source decision, then confidence, than <i>remember/know/guess</i>. This order -- as well as the specific prompt for the confidence rating -- might end up being very important in this line of research. Hmm...</p>

		<p>Quiet April here on the blog -- I spent most of the month running subjects and working on another project I can't talk too much about yet. In the meantime, though, I'm preparing for the Show Me Mini Mental Life Conference, a small biannual (that means once every two years, right, or is that "biennial") conference jointly hosted by Washington University and Mizzou a bit down I-64. I'm giving a talk on some of my dissertation data, which I've written about in other places (<a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a>).</p>

<p>As you might know, my dissertation research is interested in confidence-accuracy differences as a function of <i>remembering</i>, <i>knowing</i>, and <i>guessing</i>. What we can do is plot calibration curves for the accuracy of responses given while in each qualitative state of remembering. Here's the figure: </p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/cud4eywjczlgxog/Screenshot%202014-05-05%2014.25.58.png" alt="Calibration curves" width="" height="" border="" align=""> </p>

<p>As the figure shows, one type of response seems to pull apart from the rest. Namely, we see that <i>remember</i> responses given with high (e.g., 80-100) confidence appear to be significantly more accurate, on average, than <i>remember</i> responses given with lower confidence as well as any <i>know</i> or <i>guess</i> responses. Thus, the real-world implication is that if I'm sure I remember something, and can remember specific details about that memory (rather than a gut feeling or hunch that it happened), it's likely that the memory is an accurate one.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="04/22/pilotDataForDissertationExperiment.html">Pilot data for dissertation experiment</a></div>
		<p>Thanks to data collection efforts last week I have seven subjects' worth of pilot data for <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a> Experiment 3. The temporary Excel file is saved as "E2 Pilot Data Check.xlsx" in the Dropbox folder. The first step was to ensure that no data has been lost as a result of programming errors. The good news is that all subjects have 100 observations in the study phase and 300 in the recognition test phase, which means nothing's getting swallowed up. This is great.  </p>

<p>Next is taking a look at recognition memory performance and comparing it with prior research. Right now "old" rates for targets, related lures, and unrelated lures are .81, .47 and .17 respectively. Data from <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a> Experiment 2 are in the same ballpark (.71, .29, .17). So initial data collection suggests folks are more conservative in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 2, which is certainly a possibility.</p>

<p>So now some time needs to be spent thinking about which analyses are the crucial ones in Experiment 3. Let's recopy what I wrote as a summary of the Experiment 2 data: </p>

<p>In general, targets receive remember responses and related lures receive know and guess responses. Confidence ratings are highest for remember, intermediate for know, and lowest for guess.</p>

<p>Currently, there are not significant differences in calibration (between-subjects and between-events) between remember and know responses. There are, however, significant differences in resolution (within-subjects and within-items). </p>

<p>Therefore, Experiment 2 of my dissertation proves that qualitative state of remembering (remembering versus knowing) affects the strength of the confidence-accuracy correlation. </p>

<p>The main question is calibration and resolution for the source accuracy-confidence relationship, I think. Everything else is icing on the cake.</p>

<p>So far -- and this is a super quick analysis -- there's an interesting difference in confidence-accuracy relationship depending on whether we're looking at recognition or source accuracy.</p>

		<p>I have been taking digital photographs since 2003. My collection is a mess, and I have no idea what to do about it. Everything from 2003-2009 is on an external hard drive, basically, and 2009 on is on the hard drive of the machine I'm updating currently. In 2003 it made sense to organize photos by albums, but in the modern era of cellphone cameras and one or two pictures per day forever, it makes more sense to organize in other ways (e.g., day/month/year, faces, locations). Much of my stuff is in Aperture right now, which I purchased thinking it would be a helpful upgrade over iPhoto, but it was a waste of money -- I feel it works even worse.</p>

<p>So what do I do? Here's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>(1) Get all the files in one location, on my computer. File structure doesn't matter as much as having everything in one place does.</p>

<p>(2) Back those up on multiple drives in multiple locations, including the cloud (not sure where to go here -- Flickr offers the free terabyte, but I'd rather pay for Dropbox or Google. Meanwhile, most of my devices play the nicest with iCloud).</p>

<p>(3) Find some photo organizer/viewer that works the best. Whether this is iPhoto, Aperture, Picasa, or what I don't know and can't say. I guess this will take some research. (It seems as if photo organization has really taken a hit in the current era of the closed web, doesn't it?)</p>

<p>(4) Start to organize in a way that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.</p>

<p>(5) Back all of that up too.</p>

<p>Am I right? Am I wrong? Any hints? Please help!</p>

<p>It's an interesting idea to think about. At face value the idea makes sense -- a million people out there, any number of which have the time, energy, and expertise to evaluate your writing critically. But I'm not sure the evidence is out there suggesting that people actually do that. When I read critiques of news articles, they seem partisan or opinion based -- "I think this article is wrong because I disagree with you." Peer review, at its best, does more than this. Readers and commenters will be quick to pick up on and take down obvious flaws and logical fallacies. But can you count on them to investigate statistical analyses, interpretations of scientific theory? Do your readers know how to bootstrap, score psychological measures, or do a shift of benchwork?</p>

<p>A few of them do, but it's irresponsible to assume that those people are out there and are willing and motivated to clean up any mistakes you made. Scientific peer review, despite its faults, ensures that at least some wise brains have the professional responsibility to evaluate your arguments. Ideally, it matches up subject matter experts -- people who <i>can</i> bootstrap and evaluate theory, to continue the example -- to papers that require it.</p>

<p>Data journalists would be wise to seek out impartial reviewers instead of assuming that readers, commenters, and other publications will do the job of ensuring accuracy for them.</p>
