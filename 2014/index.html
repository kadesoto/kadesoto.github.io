		<p>A few accomplishments today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Looked over Adam's paper draft that he'll be resubmitting in a few hours. It's looking pretty good. Will try and link to it once it's published.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of the day was spent working on proofreading and editing the <i>Science </i>paper, and other rigamarole associated with getting the publication out the door. The page proofs are looking really nice and it'll be exciting to share it with readers here before the end of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>Also spent some time working on a few professional development issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Deniz is running seven (or so) subjects as we speak.</p></li>
<li><p>And lastly, the day was capped off by a pleasant surprise visit by <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~ab259/">Andrew Butler</a>, Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He's a fabulous researcher who is bound to continue a great career in the land of beef brisket.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. Made arrangements for another meeting with <a href="http://neonelectrons.webs.com/">the Neon Electrons</a> this Friday.</p>

<p>I bumped into an error with my new experiment file so had to re-download it to a memory stick. I'm headed into the testing room now to get the updated copy on all of the machines.</p>

		<p>15-E4 was only set up to take 80 different subject numbers, except this experiment's going to require 80 folks at least -- probably more like 96 - 128. So I went in to the source code and increased the range of allowable subject numbers. </p>

<p>I took that as an opportunity to create a new Github repository for the source code of the experiment. <a href="https://github.com/kadesoto/15-E4">You can get to it by clicking here</a>. Since I do most of my coding on the timeline, things don't work as well as they ought to, but you can still download and explore the software yourself if you're interested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/4/7154107/amazon-prime-customers-now-get-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-photos">just noticed this headline</a> about Amazon offering unlimited photo storage to Prime customers. A few thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Before long, it won't be the space that's the seller, rather, who can offer the best search, organization, filtering, etc. In my opinion Google's top here for the time being, partly because of the auto-enhance features.</p></li>
<li><p>The more places can host your photos for free, the more likely they are to be backed up in more than one location. But that also means that's one more place your photo is floating around for someone to access it against your will. Say you take a photo you didn't mean to and it's automatically beamed to an unlimited number of backup systems. How do you ever make sure you've deleted it! Security's also going to be more important in this area.</p></li>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="11/03/readRowland2014.html">Read Rowland (2014)</a></div>
		<p>For lab meeting this week we're reading a testing effect review by Rowland (2014). It is a heroic effort. The main ideas are summed up well on p. 21, in the Conclusions section, where it is noted that a retrieval difficulty hypothesis is supported, whereas a transfer-appropriate processing account is not. Additional support was found for semantic elaboration accounts, like Mary's mediator hypothesis, but the bottom line is that currently, no one unifying account can explain all testing data.</p>

<p>Another interesting finding was that benefits of testing emerged immediately as well as a delay, which dovetails with some things Karpicke has been saying lately about the "crossover" in testing being an artifact of test difficulty and item selection effects.</p>

<p>The somewhat unsatisfying, but honest, conclusion is on p. 22, where it is stated that "the underlying mechanisms that produce the effect remain elusive," and that "the testing effect is likely to reflect multiple memory mechanisms." In other words, there's lots more work to be done.</p>

		<p>The IRB for my main research line was expiring soon, so this morning I submitted a continuing review form to keep it open, noting that 63 additional subjects had been consented since the last time I did the review. I also added Lena to the IRB so that she can help with data collection in the case that I am incapacitated (or, more likely, am unable to make into the lab for whatever reason).</p>

<p>Edit: The IRB has been approved.</p>

		<p>Up to 61 subjects for the fourth dissertation experiment. This is great as it means we have 15-16 subjects in each of the four conditions. There was a no-show in one of the sessions earlier today, which means we need to go 58, 63, 64, ... when data collection resumes on Monday afternoon. Things are coming along, which is great.</p>

		<p>And I'm wiped! This puts us at a total of 48. That's probably half of what we want at a minimum, with 24 per condition, although you could possibly go down to 20 or 16 if you really wanted to. We'll see what time and resources allow. </p>

<p>Yesterday I also installed air fresheners and put Lysol wipes in the labs to keep things clean. With so many subjects, the testing computers do actually start to get pretty gross. These safeguards will hopefully prevent against things, at least to a certain extent. </p>

<p>That's all for today. Not much to update. We had an interesting lab meeting where we read Storm, Friedman, Murayama, and Bjork (2014) and Peterson and Mulligan (2014). Interesting papers related to the testing effect. I'll save my thoughts.</p>

		<p>In the period between my birthday (mid-October) and the holidays, I tend to eat a lot of junk, partly because it's cold and miserable and partly because there's a lot of junk around to be eaten. Here's the proof, a chart of body weight from May 2013 to October 2014.</p>

<p>Clearly October through January was not good for me (ignore May through July, which was self-proclaimed weight training season).</p>

<p>So to fight that uptick, I'm making a hard no alcohol, no dessert rule for the next four weeks, with possible exceptions for Halloween and Nov. 20-23 for the upcoming Psychonomics conference. </p>

<p>Anyone else want to join in?</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="10/28/pilotDataForDissertationExperiment4.html">Pilot data for dissertation Experiment 4</a></div>
		<p>I proposed an additional dissertation experiment and am amid data collection for it. My research assistant Deniz and I have consented 40 subjects. Two subject numbers were unable to complete the study in the allotted time (#13 and #14). We re-ran a new #14, but still need to re-run a #13. Somehow we also skipped #10. Thus, when data collection resumes tomorrow, we'll do 10, 13, and 41. The reason subject numbers are important in my study is that they're tied in the programming to the counterbalancing groups and experimental conditions. Thus, if one number is no good, we just throw it out and get another one.</p>

<p>Of course, the reason to go in and look at the data mid-data collection is just to ensure that everyone's completing the study as expected and that there are no bugs or glitches in the program. This process alerted me to one potential issue -- currently, if someone doesn't make a source decision (i.e., they selected NEW on the source test), I grade their source accuracy as INCORRECT. Obviously this is wrong -- when computing overall source accuracy, we should only look at OLD responses.</p>

<p>This has the potential to get pretty sticky and confusing as things progress, so I'll have to think carefully about these issues while working on the writeup.</p>
