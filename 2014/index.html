		<p>15-E4 was only set up to take 80 different subject numbers, except this experiment's going to require 80 folks at least -- probably more like 96 - 128. So I went in to the source code and increased the range of allowable subject numbers. </p>

<p>I took that as an opportunity to create a new Github repository for the source code of the experiment. <a href="https://github.com/kadesoto/15-E4">You can get to it by clicking here</a>. Since I do most of my coding on the timeline, things don't work as well as they ought to, but you can still download and explore the software yourself if you're interested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/4/7154107/amazon-prime-customers-now-get-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-photos">just noticed this headline</a> about Amazon offering unlimited photo storage to Prime customers. A few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><ol><li>Before long, it won't be the space that's the seller, rather, who can offer the best search, organization, filtering, etc. In my opinion Google's top here for the time being, partly because of the auto-enhance features.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol><li>The more places can host your photos for free, the more likely they are to be backed up in more than one location. But that also means that's one more place your photo is floating around for someone to access it against your will. Say you take a photo you didn't mean to and it's automatically beamed to an unlimited number of backup systems. How do you ever make sure you've deleted it! Security's also going to be more important in this area.</li></ol></li>

		<p>For lab meeting this week we're reading a testing effect review by Rowland (2014). It is a heroic effort. The main ideas are summed up well on p. 21, in the Conclusions section, where it is noted that a retrieval difficulty hypothesis is supported, whereas a transfer-appropriate processing account is not. Additional support was found for semantic elaboration accounts, like Mary's mediator hypothesis, but the bottom line is that currently, no one unifying account can explain all testing data.</p>

<p>Another interesting finding was that benefits of testing emerged immediately as well as a delay, which dovetails with some things Karpicke has been saying lately about the "crossover" in testing being an artifact of test difficulty and item selection effects.</p>

<p>The somewhat unsatisfying, but honest, conclusion is on p. 22, where it is stated that "the underlying mechanisms that produce the effect remain elusive," and that "the testing effect is likely to reflect multiple memory mechanisms." In other words, there's lots more work to be done.</p>

		<p>The IRB for my main research line was expiring soon, so this morning I submitted a continuing review form to keep it open, noting that 63 additional subjects had been consented since the last time I did the review. I also added Lena to the IRB so that she can help with data collection in the case that I am incapacitated (or, more likely, am unable to make into the lab for whatever reason).</p>

<p>Edit: The IRB has been approved.</p>

		<p>Up to 61 subjects for the fourth dissertation experiment. This is great as it means we have 15-16 subjects in each of the four conditions. There was a no-show in one of the sessions earlier today, which means we need to go 58, 63, 64, ... when data collection resumes on Monday afternoon. Things are coming along, which is great.</p>

<p>Yesterday I also installed air fresheners and put Lysol wipes in the labs to keep things clean. With so many subjects, the testing computers do actually start to get pretty gross. These safeguards will hopefully prevent against things, at least to a certain extent. </p>

<p>That's all for today. Not much to update. We had an interesting lab meeting where we read Storm, Friedman, Murayama, and Bjork (2014) and Peterson and Mulligan (2014). Interesting papers related to the testing effect. I'll save my thoughts.</p>

		<p>In the period between my birthday (mid-October) and the holidays, I tend to eat a lot of junk, partly because it's cold and miserable and partly because there's a lot of junk around to be eaten. Here's the proof, a chart of body weight from May 2013 to October 2014.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/8e9owqlinpl6m47/Screenshot%202014-10-28%2016.04.11.png?dl=0"></p>

<p>Clearly October through January was not good for me (ignore May through July, which was self-proclaimed weight training season).</p>

<p>So to fight that uptick, I'm making a hard no alcohol, no dessert rule for the next four weeks, with possible exceptions for Halloween and Nov. 20-23 for the upcoming Psychonomics conference. </p>

<p>Anyone else want to join in?</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="10/28/pilotDataForDissertationExperiment4.html">Pilot data for dissertation Experiment 4</a></div>
		<p>I proposed an additional dissertation experiment and am amid data collection for it. My research assistant Deniz and I have consented 40 subjects. Two subject numbers were unable to complete the study in the allotted time (#13 and #14). We re-ran a new #14, but still need to re-run a #13. Somehow we also skipped #10. Thus, when data collection resumes tomorrow, we'll do 10, 13, and 41. The reason subject numbers are important in my study is that they're tied in the programming to the counterbalancing groups and experimental conditions. Thus, if one number is no good, we just throw it out and get another one.</p>

<p>Of course, the reason to go in and look at the data mid-data collection is just to ensure that everyone's completing the study as expected and that there are no bugs or glitches in the program. This process alerted me to one potential issue -- currently, if someone doesn't make a source decision (i.e., they selected NEW on the source test), I grade their source accuracy as INCORRECT. Obviously this is wrong -- when computing overall source accuracy, we should only look at OLD responses.</p>

<p>This has the potential to get pretty sticky and confusing as things progress, so I'll have to think carefully about these issues while working on the writeup.</p>

		<p>It's a good day today -- we found out that our paper was accepted for publication in <i>Science</i>. I've been vague when discussing it for a while now (heck, maybe for even a year or so) as to not spoil the punchline, and it turns out that the contents are under embargo for at least another month or two anyway, so I can't share many details. What I can share, though, is that it should be a neat paper of general interest. Hopefully, too, it'll start to raise some interesting questions for collective memory researchers, as well as suggest some new ways of considering an interesting set of questions in a quantitative way. Keep an eye on this space and I'll start sharing things as soon as I have the opportunity.</p>

		<p>It's been about three months without any updates here -- my apologies about that. The reason is that I stopped using Dropbox, and without Dropbox, there's no way to update this blog. There have been a few times when I've wanted to write a post, though, and for that reason I decided to reactivate Dropbox just for blogging purposes. So, hopefully, there'll be more of this to come.</p>

<p>Why did I stop using Dropbox, you might ask? Through a pretty roundabout set of developments. I've fallen in love with Google+ Photos. I love how the pictures I take on my iPhone are uploaded to the cloud, auto-enhanced, and organized in a meaningful way. I ran out of space on my Google Drive because I uploaded some photos. Because it didn't make sense to maintain some files in Dropbox and some in Google Drive, I eliminated Dropbox -- after all, their photo tools are inferior, even considering Carousel (which I haven't looked into in a while; I ought to).</p>

<p>So bottom line -- Google+ Photos are awesome. They're so good, in fact, I think I'm going to get a Nexus 6 when they're announced instead of an iPhone.</p>

		<p>The last few weeks I've been spending a lot of time on a top-secret project and professional development-type things, so there hasn't been too much to discuss in research notes. The good news, though, is that (I believe) data collection is completed for the third experiment of my dissertation. We have 64 subjects, evenly balanced in terms of counterbalancing condition.</p>

<p>I've not done much in the way of analysis on these data but one thing I'm looking at is whether the general pattern of results replicate what I've discussed in earlier places. So far it looks as if this is the case, which is good to see.</p>

<p>(A few seconds ago I refreshed my Twitter page to see that a <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2014/07/29/aiming-for-an-a-study-habits-you-should-adopt-and-avoid/">USA Today post is out about a recent study techniques review</a>. Strangely, no link to the original article is included. I can't find one either in a few minutes of searching.)</p>

<p>One thing I've been working on in free time is the Data Science specialization track offered through Coursera and Johns Hopkins. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripBottom">You might find it interesting, too</a>.</p>

<p>Hope to have interesting things here myself over the next few days.</p>
