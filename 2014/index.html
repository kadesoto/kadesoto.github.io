		<p>Thanks to data collection efforts last week I have seven subjects' worth of pilot data for <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a> Experiment 3. The temporary Excel file is saved as "E2 Pilot Data Check.xlsx" in the Dropbox folder. The first step was to ensure that no data has been lost as a result of programming errors. The good news is that all subjects have 100 observations in the study phase and 300 in the recognition test phase, which means nothing's getting swallowed up. This is great.  </p>

<p>Next is taking a look at recognition memory performance and comparing it with prior research. Right now "old" rates for targets, related lures, and unrelated lures are .81, .47 and .17 respectively. Data from <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a> Experiment 2 are in the same ballpark (.71, .29, .17). So initial data collection suggests folks are more conservative in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 2, which is certainly a possibility.</p>

<p>So now some time needs to be spent thinking about which analyses are the crucial ones in Experiment 3. Let's recopy what I wrote as a summary of the Experiment 2 data: </p>

<p>In general, targets receive remember responses and related lures receive know and guess responses. Confidence ratings are highest for remember, intermediate for know, and lowest for guess.</p>

<p>Currently, there are not significant differences in calibration (between-subjects and between-events) between remember and know responses. There are, however, significant differences in resolution (within-subjects and within-items). </p>

<p>Therefore, Experiment 2 of my dissertation proves that qualitative state of remembering (remembering versus knowing) affects the strength of the confidence-accuracy correlation. </p>

<p>The main question is calibration and resolution for the source accuracy-confidence relationship, I think. Everything else is icing on the cake.</p>

<p>So far -- and this is a super quick analysis -- there's an interesting difference in confidence-accuracy relationship depending on whether we're looking at recognition or source accuracy.</p>

		<p>I have been taking digital photographs since 2003. My collection is a mess, and I have no idea what to do about it. Everything from 2003-2009 is on an external hard drive, basically, and 2009 on is on the hard drive of the machine I'm updating currently. In 2003 it made sense to organize photos by albums, but in the modern era of cellphone cameras and one or two pictures per day forever, it makes more sense to organize in other ways (e.g., day/month/year, faces, locations). Much of my stuff is in Aperture right now, which I purchased thinking it would be a helpful upgrade over iPhoto, but it was a waste of money -- I feel it works even worse.</p>

<p>So what do I do? Here's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>(1) Get all the files in one location, on my computer. File structure doesn't matter as much as having everything in one place does.</p>

<p>(2) Back those up on multiple drives in multiple locations, including the cloud (not sure where to go here -- Flickr offers the free terabyte, but I'd rather pay for Dropbox or Google. Meanwhile, most of my devices play the nicest with iCloud).</p>

<p>(3) Find some photo organizer/viewer that works the best. Whether this is iPhoto, Aperture, Picasa, or what I don't know and can't say. I guess this will take some research. (It seems as if photo organization has really taken a hit in the current era of the closed web, doesn't it?)</p>

<p>(4) Start to organize in a way that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.</p>

<p>(5) Back all of that up too.</p>

<p>Am I right? Am I wrong? Any hints? Please help!</p>

<p>It's an interesting idea to think about. At face value the idea makes sense -- a million people out there, any number of which have the time, energy, and expertise to evaluate your writing critically. But I'm not sure the evidence is out there suggesting that people actually do that. When I read critiques of news articles, they seem partisan or opinion based -- "I think this article is wrong because I disagree with you." Peer review, at its best, does more than this. Readers and commenters will be quick to pick up on and take down obvious flaws and logical fallacies. But can you count on them to investigate statistical analyses, interpretations of scientific theory? Do your readers know how to bootstrap, score psychological measures, or do a shift of benchwork?</p>

<p>A few of them do, but it's irresponsible to assume that those people are out there and are willing and motivated to clean up any mistakes you made. Scientific peer review, despite its faults, ensures that at least some wise brains have the professional responsibility to evaluate your arguments. Ideally, it matches up subject matter experts -- people who <i>can</i> bootstrap and evaluate theory, to continue the example -- to papers that require it.</p>

<p>Data journalists would be wise to seek out impartial reviewers instead of assuming that readers, commenters, and other publications will do the job of ensuring accuracy for them.</p>

		<p>So more for my notes than anything else, here's a figure that shows the number of times subjects say <i>remember</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>guess</i> with varying levels of confidence.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/02wxlmogk9z5djz/Screenshot%202014-04-08%2014.22.37.png" alt="Figure" width="" height="" border="" align=""> </p>

<p>You can see that there's an overwhelming number of maximum confidence <i>remember</i> responses. These responses are made with confidence ratings of 90 to 100. Some take this as evidence that the phenomenon of <i>remembering</i> is all-or-none -- perhaps the observations of <i>remember</i> assigned lower confidence values are just noise.</p>

		<p>My dissertation research is turning out to be somewhat timely -- a colleague of mine in the Behavior, Brain, and Cognition program recently gave a brief talk for the department reporting that she wasn't able to find some of the results reported in another paper (one relevant to my dissertation). I suppose it's not quite my place to talk about it here, so I'll just attach the figure, for my own reference, that adds to the discussion:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/b1bo9lhq8jxng0y/Screenshot%202014-04-03%2012.59.40.png" alt="Replication of Ingram, Mickes, and Wixted (2012)" width="" height="" border="" align=""> </p>

<p>If you want to know more, you can e-mail me directly.</p>

<p>This interesting issue raises a larger point that I have been concerned about for a few weeks now. To what extent is a fellow researcher authorized to discuss research presented in department talks and colloquia? What is the best way to cover topics discussed in these sessions? Traditionally, researchers discuss data that are in progress or have not been finalized, published, or sometimes even double-checked. At the same time, though, it's rare to hear a presenter warn, "Please don't tell others about this research until it has been published." So what is the appropriate way to share an interesting talk you've heard? Do you only discuss work that has been published, as a ground rule? Do you speak about unpublished research, but in a vague way? Do you assume that if the research has been presented in a public talk, it's fair game? Is there a difference when research is presented in a lab meeting versus a brown bag versus a department talk?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone older and wiser than me can share their opinions.</p>

		<p>Getting around to reading this neat review of the <i>remember/know</i> procedure written by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001298">Migo, Mayes, and Montaldi (2012)</a> (<a href="http://technimentis.com/pages/paywalls"><i class = "fa fa-dollar"></i></a>). It covers some interesting issues in the use of <i>remember/know</i> judgments as well as some best practices. Here are some assorted notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>p. 1437: A messy figure good for showing the complicated confidence/<i>RKG</i>/memory interrelationships</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1439: Distinctions between <i>remember/know</i> and source memory tasks</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1441: The beginning of a helpful section relating <i>remember/know</i> to confidence</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1442: Citation to Smith, Wixted, and Squire (2011), which I should add to the reading list</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1443: Discussion of how "false recollection" can be due to "true," yet mis-connected, recollections</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The authors also outline some valuable guidelines for working with <i>RKG</i> judgments in the laboratory:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Include the exact instructions in the manuscript</p></li>
<li><p>Describe any instruction checks used during the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>Describe any instruction checks used after the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>Declare any rules for elimination or replacing of subjects</p></li>
<li><p>Include "the measurement assumption used to calculate familiarity performance" (p. 1446)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these are self-evident, but it's good to see them in print. Later on (p. 1446) there's a discussion of how the Rajaram (1993) instructions suggest that <i>know</i> responses can only be made when a subject is certain an item was presented. This isn't true, and Montaldi et al. (2006) discusses this further.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>p. 1448: An interesting suggestion that subjects who have <i>remember</i> rates over 50% should be excluded</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1449: A recommendation against using <i>guess</i> responses -- oops!</p></li>
<li><p>p. 1449: Some criticisms of Ingram et al. (2012), which my work is partially inspired by</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, a valuable article that'll be added to the project folder.</p>

		<div class="divBlogHomeItemTitle"><a href="03/31/morePersonalDataTrackingNetCalories.html">More personal data tracking: Net calories</a></div>
		<p>I went out with some friends on Friday night and was surprised to get at least four comments, from people I don't talk to on a regular basis, about my updates (which most come across via Facebook). The gist of the comments is that my updates seemed frequent, but not yet to the point of irritation -- at least I hope! -- and occasionally even a little interesting. Hannah gave some good feedback and said she wanted to see a little more personal data, so I'll oblige -- direct any complaints to her!</p>

<p>Her first note that it would be good to see some mood and psychological wellbeing data. I haven't collected any of that yet, so I decided to start. I signed up for the Track Your Happiness project -- which I've done before -- and <a href="http://trackyourhappiness.org">which you can do here</a>. More on that when I get to it.</p>

<p>But in the meantime I thought I would present some data on nutrition and calories (another suggested topic), in case it's a area of interest. Here is a <i>rough</i> approximation of my net calories consumed since January 1. This figure represents the amount I've eaten in a day minus any exercise I've done (the red line is my rough total expenditure for a given day without any exercise):</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/npruzf2tcmn3btq/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.42.19.png"></p>

<p>Like many of us I started the new year off with a diet but also a marathon training plan (I'm a firm believer in the strategy of "over-promise and under-deliver"). The general upward trend in net calories suggests that the diet has tapered off as the amount of running has increased. Around February 23 or so, I upped things even more (and as a result have been less conscientious about tracking such things).   </p>

<p>We can compare this figure with total calories (or maybe we should call this "gross calories"?):</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nycrwekebk5rs6z/Screenshot%202014-03-31%2012.55.02.png"></p>

<p>Make any comparisons you like, I suppose!</p>

<p>One final note: Of course this tracking is imprecise and most likely underestimates intake significantly (and never overestimates). So things may look a little stricter than they actually were.</p>

<p>Here's hoping this is interesting somehow!</p>

		<p>I've been writing about my dissertation research here for a while now, but of course it makes very little sense getting these updates <i>in media res</i>. I've held off on writing an introductory post because doing so would take too many words and would not be all too fun to read. </p>

<p>So I decided: Why not do a brief audio post on it, instead, so you can get caught up if you like?</p>

<p>If you get a chance to listen in, I would love to get some comments and questions.</p>

<p>I've also added a link to the podcast on the project overview page -- <a href="http://technimentis.com/experimentList/currentResearchLines/15Dissertation.html">Project 15</a>.</p>

		<p>I have a few free minutes today, so I've been spending some time learning how to use Python for statistical programming. It is not a friendly learning curve so far. <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">I started by installing Anaconda</a>, a package that includes, as far as I can tell, everything you need to get started. <a href="http://ipython.org/">Once I did that I got IPython running</a>, which is -- again, as far as I can tell -- a browser-based client for doing stats in Python.</p>

<p>Then I mostly followed a tutorial that assumed I knew <i>way</i> more than I actually did.</p>

<p>A neat feature I discovered is that <a href="http://ipython.org/">you can use the IPython Notebook Viewer to share your statistics with others</a>. <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3695301/Basics.ipynb.json?create=1">Click on this link here to see the stats that I ran</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that I conducted a t-test, and a one-way ANOVA! On what, that's a good question, but at least I executed those steps.</p>

<p>So clearly, here's what I need to learn in order to get useful at this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to take data off of my webservers and get them into IPython</p></li>
<li><p>Run basic t-tests and ANOVAs with said data</p></li>
<li><p>Do correlation and regression analyses with said data</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things sound <i>too</i> difficult -- rather, it's the conditional analyzing, etc. (e.g., averaging across subjects -- how does one do this?) -- that'll be challenging to learn.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips, tricks, or good places to get started, feel free to share them.</p>
